        Reposting because useful: our guide to good security practices for journalists and non-profits in the United States https://techsolidarity.org/resources/basic_security.htm ... 
        Lessons Trump learned: the press will praise him for military action. Lessons adversaries learned: you can provoke Trump by killing children
        I hope my 2016 taxes went to pay for the left fin of a Tomahawk missile that hit an airport tarmac, and were not squandered on health care
        Adventures in Facebook fail: try to remove a phone number from your account and it will just appear there crossed out. No way to delete it
        Further adventures in Facebook fail: add a security key to your account and homepage nags you for your phone number (strictly less secure)
        It would be easier to defend WhatsApp from false accusations if Facebook wasn't trying its hardest to harvest your phone number
        Adventures in Gmail failure: there's no way to set up secure 2FA without first giving your phone number, which you have to remove at the end
        No journalist or activist in 2017 should be using Gmail without a security key. Buy one and I'll help you set it up:https://www.amazon.com/Yubico-Y-123-FIDO-U2F-Security/dp/B00NLKA0D8 ... 
        This is absolutely and categorically false. Gmail is safest. RT @AninstanceOfMe: No journalist or activist in 2017 should be using Gmail.
        Helpful mnemonic: "Gmail + chrome + security key = online bookmarking site won't be making fun of me"
        Of course, the only true protection for email is a strongly-worded sig lambasting the NSA
        For 99.999% of us, the US gov't is not the threat. Phishing is the threat. Security keys protect your email from phishing, nothing else will
        Yes! I was a victim of 2FA SMS on Friday. A little social engineering got my mobile number routed to the thieves.

        The @shadowbrokerss key to eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg is legit.pic.twitter.com/QDCaHVh5vG
        This is the most "single target" exploit I have ever seen in the wild (OK, sort of wild)... Linux on DEC Alpha... 10 machines worldwide?https://twitter.com/osxreverser/status/850680130456473600 ... 
        Of course the real question is: which particular Linux on DEC Alpha installation were they interested in? Because I doubt it was academia...
        Some totally free speculation: an atomic research centre in Pakistan and/or Iran and/or India which being embargoed got the hw but not OSF/1
        Alphas in the late 90s and early 00s ran circles around anything else computationally and even an entry-level EV56 would be serious kit...
        for example a Brazilian in the group which received the first three DEC Alphas in the UK was not allowed to use them at Uni because Brazil..
        was not a signatory of the NPT. It was weird having to disable a postdoc's account on the Alphas overriding the NIS passwd file.
        Smuggling an Alpha into a country is not that difficult (my dad's DPS-6 prototype board is sitting in a Moscow museum...) but software and..
        in particular the compiler CD with PAKs is a little harder to land your hands on. Linux on DEC Alpha was probably good enough and more...
        People probably knew how to use Linux than OSF/1.
        Might not be interesting to young minds but this eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz is gold for 90s old farts :P

        We used to run OpenBSD on DEC Alpha for http://l0pht.com  to get the small population protection.https://twitter.com/cynicalsecurity/status/850680720162947073 ... 
        Yes, significant perf loss from lack of page coloring (not that bad with on-chip L2 cache in full EV5 and beyond, though) and free compilers
        The compiler issue some dealt with by building on a properly licensed machine, then running on the many Linux machines. Also math libraries.
        Could be tricky, yes. As to math libraries, IIRC people were using Goto's free one, in asm. http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/28/technology/writing-the-fastest-code-by-hand-for-fun-a-human-computer-keeps.html ...  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazushige_Goto ...

        Just got a spate of unsolicited spammy emails from foreign "PhD applicants" with attached CV & transcript. This is not how you apply.
        Seriously, this doesn't work. Whoever is advising people to do this needs to stop. You're hurting the students you tell to do it.
        If you're interested in working with a specific professor, sure, contact them. But mass spamming faculty will NOT get you into a PhD pgm.
        I assure you, if you can't handle the application instructions, you will have real trouble with the exams and dissertation requirements.

        How to tell when someone is really good at something: ask who's better.
        Modest people may demur when asked if they're good at something, but if you ask who's better than them, they can't bring themselves to lie.

        Is there a bug bounty program covering popular open source projects yet not (ab)using the private info? Maybe P0 guest posts? Anything else?
        This for instancehttps://hackerone.com/internet 
        Can get bug bounties for many core Linux kernel bugs via https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/ ...  along with libraries like SQLite that are used by Android.
        https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/patch-rewards/ ...  is not well known and covers landing security features / mitigations (not bug fixes) in *many* popular projects.
        ChromeOS & Android are open source Linux distos that pay bounties. RedHat won't pay, but will get it fixed upstream and covers more packages
        Facebook pays for the bounties offered by Python and Django through hackerone. We handle most disclosures for those projects privately.
        FWIW, former co-worker got rewarded by IBB for an nginx bug that he originally reported to nginx (not to HackerOne)

        Man, ppl denouncing the airbase bombing didn't utter a word of condemnation of the mosque attacked by the same govt. I smell Islamophobia.
        Trump authorized strikes that killed 1,000 civilians in March. But his multimillion dollar cruise missile show has made him presidential.
