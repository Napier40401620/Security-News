        Being a Humanist means trying to behave decently without expectation of rewards or punishment after you are dead.
        We'd all do well to start over again, preferably with kindergarten.
        There are plenty of good reasons for fighting, but no good reason ever to hate, to imagine that God Almighty Himself hates with you, too.

        I've wondered for a while whether custom electronics in a cartridge could bypass the Nintendo/Sega logo checks on Gameboys and Mega Drives.
        For the Gameboys, I suspect a cart could send different data for the logo and the logo check, as a type of ToCToU exploit. @byuu_san
        For Mega Drives, I don't know much about TMSS, but perhaps a cart could muck with the bus while TMSS is executing from RAM?

        OK going back to bed until July
        I suspect Docker are going to find the same thing everyone else does - companies with RHEL contracts hate running niche Linux distributions
        The Windows usecase is a little confusing to me. Linuxkit is overkill for just running existing containers under HyperV.
        Port 9pfs to Windows and you could get the same win by just doing something like Clear Containers?
        And I just can't imagine there's a huge market for people who want to pay to run Linux containers on Windows, tbh
        So it feels like it's either trying to provide an alternative to CoreOS on cloud or just making them a natural acquisition target for MS
