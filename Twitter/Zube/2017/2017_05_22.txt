        Note that plagiarism here is verbatim quotes that are cited but not quoted as such. But the kicker is Clarke's source was the *ACLU*.https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/866075038553919489 ... 
        What Clarke's did in his thesis is legitimately plagiarism, though not the most egregious kind. Letting prisoners die of neglect is worse.
        I expect all my grad students to cite sources, make quoted material clear, and to not let people in their care die of neglect.
        But I guess I'm old fashioned.
        The plagiarism won't bring Clarke down, but I suspect that citing the ACLU in his thesis might.
        These are tough times, but, as Sheriff Clarke so eloquently put it in his thesis, uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
