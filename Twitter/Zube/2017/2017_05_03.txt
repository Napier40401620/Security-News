        So today in the light of CVE-2017-5689 I learned some fun things about Intel ME/AMT... (1/N)
        (2/N) If you have AMT enabled and 16992 is in ip_local_port_range, outgoing connections hang when you get unlucky.https://serverfault.com/questions/605077/how-does-intel-amt-active-management-technology-not-interfere-with-the-tcp-ip ... 
        (3/N) The impact of CVE-2017-5689 is probably fairly low for normal users. http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/48429.html 
        (4/N) It is possible, at least on many systems, to effectively remove ME rather than trusting firmware patches.https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/wiki/How-does-it-work%3F ... 
        (5/N) The safest fix is probably to refrain from using onboard Intel network interfaces and remove Intel wifi cards.
        A great demonstration of why we need to plot the data and never trust statistics tables! https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats ... pic.twitter.com/hsivGZdpZ1

        This doesn't really match the claims made by SemiAccurate, which strongly implied full ME access
        I mean I don't want to underplay this this is a fucking disaster but simply ensuring AMT isn't provisioned will leave most people safe
        What's pretty unconscionable is that the information Intel have provided gives no good way for end users to figure out how to do that
        A quick overview of Intel's AMT vulnerability: http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/48429.html 
        Huh I just completely rewrote how this code does key management and all the tests passed first time so now I don't know what to believe
        For everyone asking: Apple hardware includes the ME. Apple hardware does not ship the AMT firmware for the ME.
        Oh good my post is on the HN front page *twice*
        Ok, my revamped take on https://semiaccurate.com/2017/05/01/remote-security-exploit-2008-intel-platforms/ ...  : someone who's been complaining about ME for years saw a copy of the CVE early
        I don't think there's any evidence that this vulnerability is what they believe they discovered years ago, and I doubt that it is
        I can't imagine *anyone* at Intel ignoring someone claiming that they had an authentication bypass for AMT
        Ok Homekit uses HKDF, chacha20, ED25519 and SRP. How many crypto primitives do you need to turn on a lightbulb?
        One of these things is not like the others, and also wtf?pic.twitter.com/ywjzBG8Nfe
        This is relevant - the number of public host that are vulnerable to this AMT vulnerability just isn't that largehttps://twitter.com/sundhaug92/status/859283752865935360 ... 
        It's more scary in organisations where one compromised machine inside your network may now be compromise of *every* machine on your network
        Oh good apparently if you boot remote media over AMT, Secure Boot is disabled: https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/633047#EnforceSecureBoot ...  (thanks http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/48429.html?thread=1829677#cmt1829677 ... )
        https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/LEN-14963 ...  confirms that the Intel AMT vulnerability affects many Thinkpads, so "business" laptops and desktops are vulnerable
        Intel's assertion that consumer hardware is unaffected uses the word "consumer" in a way many consumers don't
        (Going to say that I'm remarkably unimpressed with how Intel has been handling this)
        I added a small section on wifi to http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/48429.html  but I don't have an appropriate Windows machine for testing. Anyone know more?
        I see Paul Graham has some hot takes today

        If you live in a suburb with a GOP Rep, this is one of those times it would be good to make a phone call.
        New GOP health plan allows states to opt in to rate discrimination based on "health status".
        Even if your state won't, the insurers will: they will retreat to the markets that allow them to operate profitably, exit individual market.
        That's fine w/ GOP: they want cross-state-lines insurers, so we all use insurance companies in North Dakota w/ no womens health coverage.
