        These are guidelines aimed at US journalists and activists, but they're a pretty good security baseline for anyone: https://techsolidarity.org/resources/basic_security.htm ... 
        Since people are asking: open source doesn't make a product more secure. Everyone now installs binaries, whether it's open or closed source
        Moreover, binaries are not some inscrutable, opaque thing that is impossible to analyze. We have the technology and the nerds who can use it
        All else being equal, open source is better for security than closed. But all else is RARELY equal!
        But you can actually check open-source software, freely. Are you sure you're not working for the CIA/NSA/FBI/GCHQ?http://www.infoworld.com/article/2985242/linux/why-is-open-source-software-more-secure.html ... 
        The vertical line in curl | sudo bash represents your secure firewall. Always use it

        The virus ecosystem is now shifting into more sophisticated ransomwares. Maybe it is the end of the antivirus era as we knew it. 1/2
        For sophisticated attacks, people need sophisticated defense system. Maybe vendors should start thinking about a new collaborative approach.

        This does not bode well.https://twitter.com/kimmaicutler/status/863674430890717185 ... 
        So I understand the argument for the NSA not informing Microsofy of vulnerabilities at the time they were discovered or acquired (1/n)
        But not informinga vendor of remote preauth vulns after the ShadowBroker tried to auction them seems quite reckless and self-defeating (2/n)
        So what's the reasoning? Not wanting to make TTPs attributable? Extending working exploits lifecycle? All seem highly venal... (3/n)
        ... and likely to blow up in their faces (which it has). Would love to hear a justification because I sure as hell can't think of one (4/4)
        sorry s/Microsofy/Microsoft/
        Well, one hypothesis has it that they did, which is why MS had a patch for it. Seems plausible, at least.

        The richest country in human history is making deliberate choices to keep its population under this form of stresshttps://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/863842766769577985 ... 
        Which is more like a dystopian hellscape: 1) USA making millions worry abt affording necessities 2) socialist Scandinavia doing the opposite
        The American economic argument seems to be that millions must be made to worry about affording necessities so that a few can be billionaires
        Remember when America allegedly couldn't afford single payer universal healthcare, and then spent trillions on Iraq and bank bailouts?
        These are clear choices which reflect a society's values, morals, principles and true priorities. Don't ever forget that.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/863846714414960640 ...

        How do alleged Russia-Trump links affect millions of people thru policy? This question has gone unexplored, as if actual people dont matter.
        Millions are struggling to get by. How palace dramas affect them is omitted by a media/political class that clearly doesnt care about them.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/863902731651756033 ... 
        Modest proposal: maybe we should also have a special commission on how the planet is heating up, threatening to wipe out all life on Earth.

        Important @gmorgenson piece on a multitrillion-dollar issue that has gotten way less coverage than it deserveshttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/business/gretchen-morgenson-pension-funds-fees.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fgretchen-morgenson ... 
        You gotta marvel at Donald Trump somehow doing the seemingly impossible: he turned a Bridgewater lawyer into a political martyr.
        Trump may indeed be eroding faith in democratic institutions, but in recent yrs did most Americans have much faith in those institutions?

        There are these voices saying: if only the NSA had released the bug 6 years ago when they found it. Imagine how fast you could go from ...
        ... from binary diff to work without the mitigations of the last 6 years.
        If the SMB1 bug would have been released 6 years ago the bloodbath would have been far worse.
        That was supposed to be: from binary diff to worm without the mitigations of the last 6 years.

        Interesting piece on how the (possibly expanding) aircraft carry-on laptop/electronics ban works in practice.https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/12/heres-how-the-laptop-ban-works-on-flights-to-the-us/ ... 
        I don't, frankly, see how carryon ban improves safety or security. If IED can be hidden in screened laptop, seems trivial to add a timer.
        Worse, the ban increases number of LiIon batteries in cargo hold, increasing risk & consequences of accidental fire.
        It sounds like, at best, the ban is a response to a very specific, narrow threat, inviting the adversary to adapt accordingly.
        Worse, presumably those boxed laptops are all stowed in the same area of the hold. So if one detonates, batteries in the rest feed the fire.
        According to this Aviation reporter, that is precisely what's causing trouble fight now.https://twitter.com/AlexInAir/status/863113300959256582 ... 
        Since this is getting RT'd a lot, I should note: None of these are easy, especially at scale. Just boring.https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/863468401708216321 ...

        Getting a lot of "sure it's easy! All you have to do is <thing that's harder than it sounds>".
        The Wannacrypt ransomware authors seem to have had the same success disaster as the Morris worm. The more things change...
        Credible estimates I've seen suggest that they've made a few $K off WCRY. It's basically burning down buildings to steal the wiring.
        OTOH, if their goal isn't to get rich but rather to cause havoc and embarrass NSA, they're doing pretty well.
        Big lesson here seems to be "patch." Hope we learn it. Big lesson of Morris worm was "buffer overflows dangerous"; took decades to sink in.

        Curious pattern: far-right trolls use reply, and far-left trolls use retweet with comment.

        I like Nick Kokonas' business writing. A lot. Also: don't write books.https://medium.com/@nickkokonas/why-we-are-self-publishing-the-aviary-cookbook-lessons-from-the-alinea-book-e89236ab6ca1 ... 
        Since people are asking: open source doesn't make a product more secure. Everyone now installs binaries, whether it's open or closed source
        Moreover, binaries are not some inscrutable, opaque thing that is impossible to analyze. We have the technology and the nerds who can use it
        All else being equal, open source is better for security than closed. But all else is RARELY equal!
        Further: ESR's "Many eyes make all bugs shallow" is one of the universal snarky jokes of software security.
        If the SMB1 bug would have been released 6 years ago the bloodbath would have been far worse.

        A cool thing about being racist is you get called "dapper" even when your suit is literally a badly formatted jpeg of a burst armchair.pic.twitter.com/HcWDdZQDao
        I learned Babai's lattice reduction solution to closest vector problem in the time it took this Dockerized django testcase to run twice.

        For the companies blocking the #WannaCry sinkholed domains, it just needs to 1) resolve, 2) establish connection, no matter the destination.pic.twitter.com/2AiFnLcoch
        I would advise to blackhole all unregistered domains to a dummy server (internal). That should work - let me know!
