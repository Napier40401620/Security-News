        Fascinating must-read for journalists too eager for a scoop in the Trump era
        The documents were expensive. The story they told about Trump was damning--for those eager enough to believe it.https://www.buzzfeed.com/kenbensinger/how-donald-trumps-enemies-fell-for-a-billion-dollar-hoax?utm_term=.pwaNYmj9P#.quQ0Bw3o7 ...

        Trumped-up fake news: Elaborate hoaxes based  on forged, but official-looking, documents.http://fb.me/3jtKtRuN9

        This is a truly remarkable story.https://www.buzzfeed.com/kenbensinger/how-donald-trumps-enemies-fell-for-a-billion-dollar-hoax?utm_term=.wivPqm709#.acOlo5827 ...

        Wars would be a lot better if guys would say to themselves sometimes "Jesus, I'm not going to do that to the enemy. That's too much."
        Like so many Americans, she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops.
        If I should ever die, God forbid, I hope you will say, "Kurt is up in heaven now." That's my favorite joke.
        How embarrassing to be human.
        If people think nature is their friend, then they sure don't need an enemy.
        The big trouble with dumb bastards is that they are too dumb to believe there is such a thing as being smart.

        The left's capacity for defeat is astonishing. Given everything Trump has done, they chose to go big on a story about a vanilla tax return?
        The only way a Trump tax return could be anything other than a huge distraction is if it turns out he files his taxes in Kenya
        There's a behavior on some sites (like facebook) so when you close a video, it minimizes to the corner and keeps playing. How to block this?

        DoJ & FBI officially charge 2 Russian FSB agents and 2 hackers of hacking Yahoo in 2014. Apparently Yahoo was right. It was a nation state.
        Canadian police already arrested one of the suspects. Attackers were very sophisticated, officials said.
        DoJ: Yahoo hackers targeted email accounts for Russian journalists, U.S. and Russian government  officials and private-sector employees
        DoJ: Yahoo and >>>GOOGLE<<< told the DoJ about the hacks.
        And here's the official press release: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-fsb-officers-and-their-criminal-conspirators-hacking-yahoo-and-millions ...

        So, shouting sadly works: my @Swisscom_B2B_en line now has IPv6 working over DHCPv6-PD *and* the bandwidth is symmetrical again... 
        still want to move away from the Swisscom "SME" service to @init7 but a bit scared because the migration is "untested" w/ cut on same fibre.
        Oh, and for future reference, @Swisscom_B2B_en does /not/ delegate PTR for /48 blocks. We are all "... http://f.1.2.1.2.0.a.2.static.wline.lns.sme.cust.swisscom.ch " :D
        Looks like HackingTeam is not present at ISS Dubai. That would be the first time in like 10 years..
        While I am forever grateful to @tweetsix & IP-max for the years of free IPv6 connectivity it is quite amazing to "feel" IPv6 at 100Mbps.
        Cracked the bandwidth issue on the fibre...  bad fibre. Bandwidth testing shows the classic see-saw of an error killing TCP window size.
        For a 30s testing period there are three-four drops from flat out to 0 and tcpdump shows the window size dropping.

        The average person who doesnt care about the sport of politics is prolly more worried about losing health insurance than about Trump's taxes

        Throwing 26 million people off health insurance is apparently not a big enough driver of TV ratings

        Haha the Hue v2 ships with an opkg.conf
        (it doesn't work but eh)
        The most amazing part of https://github.com/fantasylandinst/fcop/blob/master/README.md#faq ...  is the framing of things as being for the benefit of oppressed minorities
        Turns out that it's actually possible to have a moral system that says it's ok to say "This person is a racist" and not "This person is gay"
        Facebook just popped up a dialog titled "Matthew, we'd like to do better" which gave me hope but it's just a "usefulness" survey
        If you got to listen to me speak for 10 minutes about a topic I'm enthusiastic about, what topic would you want it to be?
        The entire world is on fire but my email is no longer on a G4 PPC with a 5400RPM 2.5" SATA drive
        The inbox that used to take 3 minutes to open is now about 3 seconds and I'm ok with this
        (Oh yeah if you sent me email and I haven't replied uh sorry I'm trying to undelete it)
        Ok currently I am leaning towards "What fruitflies teach us about software" and "My latest IoT device is a 1983 Laserdisc player"
        The strangest thing about leaving a field behind you is discovering that people are still citing papers you helped write
        Good lord I'd forgotten about the terrible hacks in http://jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/~mjg59/netlinux.html ... 
        The problem with "99% of what we give users is correct and they love the feature!" is that they'll then believe the 1% that's incorrect
        As your project gets closer to giving consistently correct results, it becomes much more important that you *always* give correct results
        Being correct 99% of the time is much more dangerous than being correct 50% of the time
        If you give a third party service permission to Tweet as you, and they get hacked, the hackers can Tweet as you.
        https://twitter.com/settings/applications ...  lists app permissions. Revoke stuff you don't trust.
        And remember that people trust your account! Someone who tweets as you can send them to a fake site that harvests passwords.
        Nazi propaganda is a long way from the worst thing people can do with your account

        Interesting new finding from @RichardvReeves: campus disinvitations most common at richest schools. 
        "The biggest wins are almost always long. 100â†’1 is tougher for compounding than 1â†’100."
        This seems to apply to more than investing. It's why it's better to be a foolish-seeming optimist than a clever cynic.
        If the optimist is right, he gets the further advantages of applying the idea. The cynic only gets to say "I told you so."
        Optimism compounds better than cynicism.
        One problem with being an ideologue is that you're forced to disagree with every idea other side has, no matter how good.
        In that situation, Rabin's adversary can make you arbitrarily stupid.

        White House preempt's Rachel Maddow's primetime report on Donald Trump's 2005 1040 forms with a bananas statement. pic.twitter.com/fyNKWLewCC
        Rachel Maddow's publication of Donald Trump's 2005 1040 form without appended documentation can easily be weaponized by the administration 1
        Strategists (like Steve Bannon) mouths water at the opportunity to deflect off of this away from other pressing issues like health care. 2
        Moreover, attention would move towards taxes as Trump prepares his 2016 filings. Some wind out of those sails after tonight's report. 3
        Elephant in room is whether forms were curated & selectively delivered to @DavidCayJ to set a fire that distracts away from other issues 4
        Both healthcare repeal & Comey's statement to congress would dominate tomorrow's headlines. Will this story suck up some oxygen? 5
        All conjecture but do you think Donald Trump, "John Barron", or one of his associates leak the 2005 1040 forms to @DavidCayJ themselves?

        2) As the "press officer", we very quickly adopted "populism" as our media strategy. It worked. Without a shred of common sense.
        3) Watching Trumps campaign, & now watching #geertwilders & other similar "populistic" politicians move forward with "simple solutions" ...
        4) scares me a lot. There are no simple solutions, & prophets claiming to have them for us should be treated with skepticism, not applause.

        Today we learned the Congressional Budget Office is the most dangerous part of the Deep State
        The good news is Trumpcare will supercharge the economy by creating jobs in the mortuary and cremation industries
        Holy crap, I'm amazed by the professionalism of whoever wrote this analysishttp://politi.co/2lURsy6 
        Big @pauldemko scoop: WH analysis of repeal is even worse than CBO analysis. (And someone inside wants it known!)http://politi.co/2lURsy6 
        Trumpcare eliminates what Americans hate about Obamacare, like higher taxes on billionaires, & keeps what we love, like gigantic deductibles
        You'd think everyone who'll suffer from Trumpcare would hate it, but more Americans than you'd guess are this personhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRx2da1L0Ls&t=36m56s ... 
        Trump's blatant violation of all his healthcare promises makes me suspect he also may not have been 100% honest about Cruz's dad killing JFK
        I'm honestly kind of impressed by the GOP's ideological commitment to murdering Americans

        Who will be the first to demand that @maddow be charged, and with what?  My guess: @seanhannity, and "espionage and treason"
        this is a catholic wedding of breaking news
        .@maddow so I missed it what was in the vault
        Plausible that Trump leaked it. WH had preemptive reply ready. Withoit Johnson's (confusing) analysis, seems like Trump paid lots of taxes.https://twitter.com/jamessurowiecki/status/841824663500161025 ...

        Here's a photo of the Trump tax returns that @maddow just displayed.
        "Disclosure could benefit Trump" says Chris Hayes - in the roll out. So why disclose now?
        Journalists saying that Trump/GOP wants to eliminate AMT without also mentioning that comes with eliminating deductions are basically liars.
        Now would be a good time to remind you that your money is way better spent on an NYT or WaPo or WSJ subscription than on cable news.
