        Ransomware won't encrypt your files if you keep everything in system32pic.twitter.com/LrzQFl74QB
        Fun fact: On 64bit versions of Windows, system32 actually has the 64bit versions of files. 
        However, if a 32bit app tries to access system32, it's redirected to SysWOW64, which holds the 32bit versions of files on 64bit Windows.pic.twitter.com/jTiJbARKlz
        The system folder is a placeholder to make sure that "C:\Windows\syste~2\" maps to system32. It's a compatibility thing.

        If your business has any legacy XP - 2003 left you have bigger problems - they are permanently vulnerable with no fix forthcoming.
        If you ignored your legacy UNIX estates from last week, it would be time to put pressure on Oracle for updates to its Solaris platform.
