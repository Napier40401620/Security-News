        All presidents lie. But it's refreshing to see one so remarkably blatant. #Jointsession
        So far, pretty much the corporate imperialist line, crudely expressed, but par for the course. #Jointsession
        Mike Pence and I are the same age, but he looks at least a decade older than me. Drinking goat blood has its downside. #Jointsession
        Trump mouths "thank you" like he expects panties to be thrown at his feet. Well, Mitch McConnell's, anyway. #Jointsession
        Today is Rare Disease Day, but every day is I Can't Believe This Psycho Is President Day. #Jointsession
        The girl who failed third grade twice still did better than Trump, who never got out of third grade. #Jointsession
        Of course the US military needs even more money. We're thisclose to warp drive and kicking Romulan ass. #Jointsession
        How bad is your life when you willingly become a human prop for Trump's bullshit? #Jointsession
        "We all bleed the same blood -- well, you people do. I buy my blood from Switzerland." #Jointsession
        Well, that was awful, something Trump regularly delivers on. #Jointsession
        This is who the Democrats send to answer Trump? Loooosers. #JointAddress
        A Democrat who favorably quotes Ronald Reagan. Beautiful. The party is in fine shape. #JointAddress
        Steve Beshear -- his opposition heat cannot be cooled! #JointAddress
        Corporate talking heads swoon over the new, "presidential" Trump. Boot licking has seen better days. #JointAddress

        @Pinboard "Coddled tech engineers don't understand the implications or consequences of their work. What'll help? Bringing donuts!"
        One thing that isn't going to help? Not bringing donuts. I stand by my decisions.
        My only regret about running meetups in tech cities is office envy. Sitting in comfy sofa, listening to postdemocratic lounge chill mix

        NYT headline: "Trump Softens Tone in Outlining Goals". This is the headline on a substantive speech? Sad!
        I know the Washington Post's motto ("Democracy Dies in Darkness") is supposed to be defiant, but it just reads like a season description
        I get delivery matters--like wearing a tie matters; signaling respect or submission depending on context--but did everyone watch with mute on?
        Washington Post headline: "Trump wins high marks for his steady, muscular tone". Ew
        If you serve America the same shit sandwich on a plate with a cocktail toothpick in it, the media will write about the improved presentation
        God, grant me the strength to change the things I can
        People who think AI or robots will cause mass unemployment are forgetting about global warming. New York City isn't going to relocate itself
        In the coming decades, climate change is likely to solve not just unemployment, but problems like obesity. And they call me a pessimist!

        What is fascinating with SGX is that it ultimately boils down to a trust mechanism and, I think we've seen enough of those ending badly...

        I measure an idea for something to work on by how many of me there would have to be before I'd have one work on it.
        One of the things I've only learned since I became old (52) is that some tasks you thought were hard become easy if you do them slowly.
        For about the first 45 years of my life, doing things slowly was an option I overlooked.
        I still think it's better to err on the side of fast than slow, but you do miss some edge cases that way.

        NED operates in Russia (https://interc.pt/2lkd421 ); its cofounder said its activities are like the CIA of the past (https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1991/09/22/innocence-abroad-the-new-world-of-spyless-coups/92bb989a-de6e-4bb8-99b9-462c76b59a16/ ... )pic.twitter.com/meJvYiE1T6

        Leo Laporte claims Tavis Ormandy never contacted Cloudflare, except for a tweet. Nick Sullivan fails to correct him.
        Earlier in the same broadcast, Laporte shows the wrong tweet, implying that Tavis went public with the bug before talking to CF at all.
        It's not OK for Laporte to get details like this wrong and it's not OK for Cloudflare to let them go un-corrected.
        9:13 in the video. Laporte "not thrilled" Ormandy "announced" this in a public tweet "instead of" contacting you directly.https://twitter.com/grittygrease/status/836701075646271488 ... 
        But that's false. @taviso talked to CF privately for a ~week before announcing this. @grittygrease doesn't mention this at all.
        I can't blame @grittygrease for not correcting the (extremely) misleading image Laporte (probably accidentally) showed of the wrong tweet.
        But I can blame Nick for not correcting LaPorte about Tavis not contacting Cloudflare!
        Literal quote: "I'm not thrilled that @taviso announced this in a public tweet, instead of contacting you directly."

        Directly. Personally. Privately. In detail. With ~1 full week, incl. weekend, of technical support from @taviso directly. Next question?https://twitter.com/grittygrease/status/836718191824904192 ...
