        Question for @elonmusk: what did the other planets ever do to deserve humanity?
        Pragmatic realist @elonmusk rejects easy moralizing in favor of a seat at the table, so he can make Mars colonies happen in our simulation
        A stronger argument @elonmusk can't make publicly: if he was a Trump collaborator, would he be working so hard to hack into base reality?

        @cynicalsecurity particularly sad because of how easy Xcode tools make handling this situation. If it were anyone but MSFT I'd be shocked
        Puzzled & concerned: one device upgrades the OpenVPN app, the other does not see it. Same iOS version different iPhone models (6S vs. 6S+).
        @cynicalsecurity roll out takes a while. Should be all synced within 8 hours?
        My #OpenBSD 6.0-current VMM is hanging after a few days of flawless op: the two VMs hang with a network I/O hang. Interesting.
        Increasing the ifp sysctl helped as it went from a day to a week so there is a network queue issue.

        80% of the time you tell a fascist to fuck gravel, the response is a variation of "how tolerant!"
        The most frequent response is not to tell you to go try to fistfuck a honey badger, or chew off your own toes, etc.
        The most common response of the fascist is to appeal to your moral sense. To convince you you've been hypocritical, immoral.
        He's counting on you to think "fuck gravel, shithead," is a greater offense than whatever shitheaded nazi trash he just said.

        If you are trying to improve security, and you do so by adding code instead of removing code, odds are that you are doing it wrong.
        Not saying new code is always wrong, but at least 9 out of 10 "more code to improve security" proposals should be discarded.

        Senate Democrats should remember that the constitution requires them to give advice and then their consent to the President's nominees.
        The President has amended his EO on immigration to prohibit residents of Berkeley, CA from entry to the United States.
        We note that the gas lights at the White House have been on continuously since the inauguration. Anyone reporting otherwise is delusional.
        That thing where you just got a new lens you've been drooling over but you're exhausted and it's dark out.
        We're committed to protecting all consumers' freedom to be swindled out of their retirement savings.https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-moves-to-kill-off-obamas-landmark-retirement-rule-1486116007 ... 
        As with health insurance, the President believes Americans should not worry about retirement savings until they actually need it.
        Repealing the rule that banks can't cheat me out of my retirement is a refreshing change from starting wars with Mexico and Australia.
        We are proud to note that just two weeks into Mr. Trump's Presidency, nobody is even bothering to worry about the emoluments clause anymore.

        If Dodd-Frank 'reformed Wall Street' why did Goldman Sachs's #2 get $285 million upon joining the government? Why is no top banker in jail?

        I doubt Trump will do this, but he could just indict a banker he doesn't like and then repeal D-F the next day. What could Dems do?

        The next crisis won't be exactly like the last crisis. It never is. But it will be caused by size, fragilility and leverage.
        Perhaps #Brexit could kick it off, or withdrawing from NAFTA or the collapse of Eurozone. Or the bricking of bank records via cyber attack.
        But it will basically be a function of no public institutions doing broad risk management along with absentee ownership by private interests

        We're broadcasting live on Facebook from the Yemeni-American protest in Brooklyn: https://interc.pt/2kuQh7c 
        It's alarming that the guy who wrote the hysterical "Flight 93 election" article is now working for Trump. But...he also worked for Bush.

        Both the US being forced to share a little power worldwide & white people having to share power inside the US lead to mindless belligerence
        It's sad Trump's president, but look on the bright side: the Clintons, Robert Rubin, Tim Geithner & Larry Summers are all incredibly rich
        Sy Hersh said Cheney discussed a false flag attack on US ships to start war with Iran. But don't worry, Trump's people are far less stable.pic.twitter.com/0XzHHcqhmA
        Consciously trying to provoke war with Iran is not just an obsession of the crazy right. The Sensible Democratic Center also thinks this waypic.twitter.com/LIAMYVkPGq

        .@jessesingal Can't fool me. Trump is dismantling FEMA except a remnant giving aid to people who saw a Sikh and drove into a tree.
        I am a week and a half into paying a fraction of my monthly cable bill for a year of WaPo and man do I feel dumb for not doing this before.

        @tqbf yes! Leave him at a table with the founder of Amway and some guy that owns three car washes.
        Unlike Bowling Green, the Oak Creek massacre did take place & the Trump Republicans have never decried the white supremacist terror attack.

        "15% of Facebook employees are vulnerable to Trump's likely changes for H-1B visas." So maybe think about a public protest next time.
