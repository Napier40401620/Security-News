        One pleasant surprise in Germany is that there seems to be openness to bringing down the trade surplus and addressing Eurozone problems.
        Traditionally the attitude was 'well we're just more productive'. Now a few see mass unemployment in Greece as induced by German policies.
        I don't want to overstate it. But I was surprised, and in a good way.
        Also Germans keep apologizing for the fact that the Trump family originally came from Germany.
