        when two or more men explain tech to me without being asked it's called the blokechain

        the first blokechain 0day logo will be the poster for the human centipede with a word bubble that says "have you read my blog"

        Man, in misguided flirting attempt: "Are those books?"
        Girls, if a guy wants you to be less (less funny, less successful, less smart) in order to feel bigger, then he's trash. You deserve MORE.

        Seems pretty common for younger men to project their insecurities on you in a variety of ways, usually passive-aggressive ones.
        Including the ever-popular "you're so smart/pretty/amazing I don't deserve you" bullshit
        Which is code for "I'm jealous and threatened and want you to agree to tone it down"
        Notice they never try to better themselves to be "worthy" of you. There's never effort on their part. It's your job to slump to their level.
        Anyway, if a guy isn't your personal damn cheerleader, you need a better entourage.
        THIS  IS  NOT  A  DRILL

        Very cool APT found in 2015 under the radar, with great mobile network knowledge (Ericsson MSC binary patching, Lua implant, ...)
        That is a good example why red teaming is a good practice nowadays, for defensive means #redteam #pentestinghttps://twitter.com/x0rz/status/854706307395461121 ...
