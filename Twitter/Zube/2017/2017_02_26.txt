        .@m0havvk Problem with reporting phishing mail are the pathetic steps you have to follow, totally unstandardized requirements per-vendor.
        .@m0havvk Which is why I focused on reporting the phishing links themselves for blocking, rather than try to fix this at the SMTP level.
        .@m0havvk Once a phishing campaign has sent, they're already in the inbox. You can't un-send them. Browser blacklists only defense left.
        .@m0havvk However, reporting phishing from within the webmail interface is easy and effective on Gmail/Outlook.com, so I will add that step!

        I'm not sure how major DC media outlets will survive without access to the White House stenography room.
        Trump is prolly right that media scrutinizes him more aggressively than it has scrutinized many past presidents, such as Bush & Obama (1/2)
        But media's past failure to scrutinize past presidents doesn't mean media should keep being weak -- i.e. 2 wrongs don't make a right (2/2)https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/835283136053293057 ... 
        Hypothesis: there might not have been an Iraq War had media scrutinized Bush as aggressively as it now (justifiably!) scrutinizes Trump
        Obama created an extrajudicial kill list, his aides boasted about that to the NYT, and journalism basically yawned.
        The best media critics are Trump-worshiping 12-hr-a-day Fox News junkies angrily decrying other media for sensationalizing political stories

        Best part of my week: seeing 1980s legend Alex English at the Nuggets game https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ61gCZBCQq/ 
        The DNC race is a good test of whether the party will be controlled by the people/interests who engineered the historic loss to Donald Trump
        Modern liberalism is a "resist Trump" fundraising solicitation from a Dem Party think tank in D.C. that's financed by Wall Street
        Modern journalism is newspapers that promoted WMD lies now launching subscription campaigns based on a call to defend truth
        Modern Dem Party politics is a DNC candidate touting the endorsement of Eric "Too Big to Jail" Holder
        Obama and Clinton deciding who will rebuild the Democratic Party destroyed on their watch is objectively awesome

        The Democratic Party, which is really a network of biglaw firms, think tanks, pollsters, pols, and NGOs, is almost totally centralized.
        Party leaders just can't see the edges. What I have a tough time understanding is why those being neglected aren't angry about the neglect.
        Here's a random ideological thought. The core problem with 'European social democracy iz awesome' is that rw fascism is rising there too.
        Higher minimum wage, universal health care, industrial policy, etc - and yet the same deep-seated xenophobia/racism...
        Yup. The center-left obsession w/the safety net ignores the fact that people don't self-identify as safety net usershttps://twitter.com/nlraths/status/835446812542644224 ... 
        People want jobs, agency, and communities. Who wants to live on welfare or charity? Who wants to make the minimum wage?
        Actually fascism rises when public institutions cede power to private governance (aka finance & monopolies).https://twitter.com/kowalski4791/status/835447358733369346 ... 
        People didn't notice Trump's anti-monopoly rhetoric, but it was appealing. He promised to take on forces unseen by the center-right and left
        Who was really governing your life the last eight years? Obama? The GOP in Congress? Or Comcast, Aetna, Google, Bank of America, etc?
        France's Macron hopes to win by not taxing "financial investments" ie speculators. @FT Instead wealth tax wd become a property tax.

        Just got mail from Hacker One, which has cleared all sessions from the range of time indicated by the Cloudflare disclosure.
        Any site could have done that the moment they learned about the Cloudflare bug, no matter what was in the Google caches.
        This is the kind of thing I'm talking about when I say that sites can do things to minimize harm, don't have to wait for Cloudflare.
