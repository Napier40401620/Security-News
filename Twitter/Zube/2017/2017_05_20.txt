        Happy the vuln was fixed before making damage, but wondering about precedent, and lack of external review. Could have been a backdoor, no?
        I assume most other cryptocurrency codebases are even less externally reviewed. Particularly scary for privacy-preserving coins.

        [DELETED-NOTE] Literal word translation of what happened in Sweden is "dropped," but case against Assange still pending. Thx @lennartregebropic.twitter.com/iCTFuPnCqq
        Adding to the confusion over people thinking the Assange case is cancelled is the difference in criminal proceedings in the US vs Sweden.
        Additionally, it seems the definition of when something turns into a "case" may be different in Sweden? I won't go further, not a lawyer.
        Fundamentally, it seems a lot of this is semantics/procedural - Assange is in an embassy and Sweden is forced to delay until timeout in 2020

        Westminster Mag's Court warrant for Assange's arrest for failing to surrender in 2012 is still valid. MPS says it's obliged to arrest.
        Swedish prosecutor says if Assange was to turn to Sweden before 2020 the preliminary investigation could be re-opened.
        Prosecutor says reason they're not pursuing the investigation is because they can't see how to advance it. Not because of evidence.
        Prosecutor says they have tried to do this investigation in the same way as other sexual offense ones. Have used all legal means at disposal
        Prosecutor says she does not want to assign blame on any particular person for this situation. But Assange has "kept himself away"
        "We did what was possible for us to do."
        Prosecutor says cost was not a circumstance that affected the decision to close the investigation
        Prosecutor: The decision taken today has nothing to do with any actions taken by the Americans
