        Ideally you want a U2F security token that can live on a keychain or necklace and is cool enough people will want one for fashion reasons
        Bottom line with funkier security key design--you want someone to say "oh cool, what's that?" and then you can start to preach the gospel
        Look into challenge coins. Lots of makers of those, and they may have the correct vibe.
        Tell me we wouldn't have half of Silicon Valley using U2F if you could get a Yubikey shaped like a 1/12 scale Millenium Falcon

        Why hasn't anyone from the Qubes fandom yet pointed out that the Shadow Brokers dump shows it is safe?
        Vulnerabilities we (@veorq+me)  found in Signal: http://pwnaccelerator.github.io/2016/signal-part1.html ... , MAC bypass and crash via malformed RTP packets, more results soon.
        Has anyone noticed that despite the age of the Shadow Brokers dump there is nothing for VMS or Tandem? Many telcos ran CDRs on Tandem or VMS
        Some examples of telcos running on Tandem cores: Sprint, Telecom Italia, CyTA, for example. At least two of probable interest.
        Did anyone see sploits for XDR bugs in the eqgrp dump? They used to be much more useful than hitting individual RPC services...
        Are the @InfiltrateCon slides online yet? @daveaitel ?

        Qubes is a good idea but building it in top of Xen is not.
