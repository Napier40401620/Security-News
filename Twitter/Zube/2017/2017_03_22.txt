        Don't confuse \1 with $1. \1 is used inside a regex; $1 (in Perl) is used outside the regex after a match.

        Radical new idea for what a mobile device should be: thin client.
        Not a web browser thin client. VNC-like. All data remote, optionally on hardware on your own physical premises. Every device is a burner.
        Not only do you eliminate searches & make replacement of potentially compromised devices trivial...
        You also kill everything cpu-hungry that precludes Nokia-candybar-era battery performance.

        Super interesting message from @KeccakTeam on hash functions to replace sha1 in git. 
        Intel Optane SSD (3D XPoint memory) is a great step forward, but currently appears to make little difference vs. other SSDs for yescrypt ROM
        Per specs, Optane's IOPS at 4 KB random read is same as other fastest SSDs' - yes, at lower queue depth, but doesn't matter for yescrypt ROM
        Byte-addressable is most important for writes; there may also be a smaller speedup for reads smaller than a page or/& crossing page boundary
        No(?) published Optane benchmarks for smaller than 4 KB and/or odd-sized/misaligned random reads yet. If anyone has such data, please share.

        Submitted a question to house intel committee specifically on QHG Holdings --interested to see how FBI & NSA respond.   #ComeyHearing
        Cayman anonymous corporate vehicle QHG Holdings holds 19.5% Rosneft stake.  Major to #ComeyHearing collusion claim https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/OC414947/filing-history ... 
        CAVEAT** QHG Holdings is a major , but once  can prove whether OR NOT someone in Trump (or someone in admin) benefited from Rosneft deal.
        FBI Director Comey declined an answer when asked about the account. LLP ID# OC414947, journalists keep digging!  https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/OC414947 ...

        Oops, new LastPass bug that affects 4.1.42 (Chrome&FF). RCE if you use the "Binary Component", otherwise can steal pwds. Full report on way.pic.twitter.com/y92vm3Ibxd
        We are aware of the report by @taviso and our team has put a workaround in place while we work on a resolution. Stay tuned for updates.
        Absolutely beautiful bug by @tehjh. Creating overly long instructions (out-of-spec) that QEMU's x86 dec accepts -> break basic block cachinghttps://twitter.com/ProjectZeroBugs/status/843836942106202112 ... 
        Known now, but back in 2010, we warned that threat models ignored the @taviso problem

        I lost 47 shipmates in a turret explosion. Trump lost 10 billion on a casino implosion.
        That's Long Island, btw. Autocorrect has a problem with my accent.
        I volunteered for military service. Trump used health care choice to find a doctor to get him out of involuntary military service.
        I carefully fact check stories I write, and admit my errors when I make them. Trump paid people to write his lies for him, denies any errors
        I have about as much direct national security experience as Steve Bannon. Trump does not know how NATO works.
        We professional anarchists stand in awe of the work being done to smash the state by @realDonaldTrump.

        I must be hallucinating. I got in the car, turned on the radio, and Trump was talking to people in Kentucky about Henry Clay's trade policy.
        So I guess Trump is really going Jacksonian, except on trade where he loves Clay. Can't wait for his views on slave trade.
        Also, want to hear all about how Trump's Indian Removal Act is going to bring factory jobs back to Kentucky.
        I cannot handle listening to Trump speak for more than a few minutes at a time, because I find myself COPYEDITING IT IN MY HEAD

        It's in everybody's interest that @POTUS get cyber right. I wanted to talk w NSC's new cyber directors. NSC spksprsn wouldn't even ID them.
