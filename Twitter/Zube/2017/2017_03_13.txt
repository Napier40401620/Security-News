        copies of my gazillion beautiful MRIs because, er, I took them until they finally agreed that me looking at my brain on OsirisX was not... 
        a threat to their position (yes, seriously, I was not apparently worthy to have my own data given to me).
        expert systems being trained on early mammographies in the late 70s by my father trying to help doctors make sense of those images. It ... 
        made sense, they had immensely expensive graphical workstations which were being "trained" by specialist radiographers, and it delivered... 
        consistently good indications to junior radiographers, invariably better than what they found and often on par with the most senior who... 
        had trained the system. It also had the guts to respond "take to senior" when it had no clue. This machine "courage" saved lives. It was,... 
        as often is the case in Italy, killed by politics. Doctors who didn't want "advice" from a machine, juniors who did not want to be told of... 
        their mistakes, etc. all going to "those in power" to keep the experiment and experiment.

        .@AJVicens the Harvard one is public vulneravility collisions with other public vulnerability researchers (so obviously higher)
        .@AJVicens But the metric that *matters* is the other way: private real exploit collisions with other private real exploits.
        .@AJVicens so the RAND one is a better approximator, but they are both approximations.
        Also missed in VEP debate is w/o mandatory fast updates for all users disclosure has directly aids short-term adversary capability.
        So you need to get that *first* because while the long-term benefits of disclosure are debatable, the short term costs w/o updates aren't.

        There are right now legit scandals of law/conflicts. Scandalizing seemingly regular process could distract from thathttps://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/840658222017073152 ... 
        Its one thing when a president fires HIS OWN US Attys he appointed. That signals scandal. But replacing the other party's after an election?
        President use legal power to replace opponents' political appointees with their own appointees. If thats a bad system, it's a system problem
        US Attys get legally mass fired = a lesson on why elections matter = a reminder that some warned Dems shoulda nominated a stronger candidate
        1. US Atty firings are routine/legal 
        Presidents get to fire the prosecutorial apparatus that enforces the law on them. That kind of system seems problematic.
        1. This Trump move was legal
        Wall St gave Obama huge cash, he then replaced Bush US Attys with people who didn't prosecute Wall St after the financial crisis
        Now Trump may replace Obama US Attys with those who may not prosecute Trump allies. Maybe the system is the problem?https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/840667371396321281 ...

        Trump firing @PreetBharara seems like great news for Andrew Cuomo...unless Bharara now runs for governor against Cuomo in 2018.

        Trump's main campaign promise was to stop the globalizers and their offshoring of jobs and immigration/terrorism. Nativism.
        And there really are economic nationalists in his administration. But they seem to be losing. Gotta wait until Robert Lighthizer confirmed.
        Haven't seem much out of Wilbur Ross at Commerce. Navarro getting destroyed by Cohn and the Goldman mafia.
        Big split between Goldman's Gary Cohn and the nationalists. Cohn big supporter of TPP, China BIT, NAFTA.https://twitter.com/LeanneStewart/status/840953619809738752 ... 
        And Trump knows his voters in the upper midwest want good jobs. He's also been an economic nationalist since the 1980s.
        Two reneged campaign promises that could get Trump in YUGE trouble are trade and infrastructure spending. (If Dems make him pay, big if)https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/840950557703569412 ... 
        big pet peeve is people who say "this is just what trump promised" some is, but many broken (now and future) promiseshttps://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/840951432882843648 ... 
        some, not all, of his "broken promises" will not get attention because they're things DC consensus mostly approves of
        broken trade promises  fine, broken medicare/social security promises fine (though the catfood commission contingent less strong than b4)
        if trump seemed competent and spoke washington speak better his agenda would get much less pushback
        screwing poor people and tax cuts for rich people are just compassionate conservatism, after all
        Trump's promises on trade, infrastructure, and health care are where he's weak. Some chunk of his voters want good jobs and health care.
        The Dems are sort of focusing a bit on health care, except too much emphasis on how awesome Obamacare is. (it's not awesome).
        Aside from Sherrod Brown and Chuck Schumer, no focus on trade or infrastructure. Because DC consensus is still NAFTA = great.
        So far the line of attack by Dems is Russia ZOMG. That's generating hysteria in DC, but the polling shows Dems are less popular than Trump.
        Both Clinton and Obama in 2008 promised to renegotiate NAFTA. Didn't. Trump hit them hard on that. He also hit 16 other GOPers on it.
        True for Sally Yates. We don't know why Preet Bharara was fired but turnover for US attorneys is the norm.https://twitter.com/KaivanShroff/status/840662870127960065 ...

        ISTM the prevalence of video-recorded presentations might stem from confusion of what's really valuable in human-human interaction... (1/)
        (2/) I highly doubt this value to be the opportunity to observe a biped walking on stage, desperate to entertain everybody in the room...
        (3/) Instead, the actual killer feature is the opportunity to influence the flow of lecture to suit one's needs and mental process...
        (4/) This can be done by asking Qs of course, but also by facial expressions, etc. Of course none of these work for recorded videos...
        (5/) So perhaps instead of videos of walking bipeds, we could use interactive "presenter" apps, which could be asked Qs to steer the flow?
        (6/6) So, something like:

        Just tested: if you join 6 Diceware words w/o separators you lose 3.1%+ of keyspace (& uniformness). EFF fixed this.https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases ... 
        At 5 Diceware words (more typical?) it's ~2.5%. passwdqc's 4096-word list would also be affected, which is why no way to disable separators.
        At 6 passwdqc words (larger keyspace than 5 Diceware words) w/o separators (misuse), keyspace reduction is 0.15%. Bad, but not Diceware bad.
