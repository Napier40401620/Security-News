        I don't get how anyone does C, when API docs don't tell if mem is reused or copied, if free operations are shallow or deep. 100% sanitizers?
        Go docs are much more systematic in flagging []byte reference reuse, with a much weaker need. (Only breaks if array modified, because GC.)

        WeWork's Adam Neumann on how to hit $1B in revenue: "Raise $4B and use it to subsidize luxury office space you rent out way below cost"

        Apple's magic donut is Juicebro in building form. Its round shape symbolizes how many fucks Apple gives about the community it lives in
        "Though vacant land in Cupertino is rare, Apple had purchased 75 acres" and made it look like parkland
        Bay Area peeps: if you drive from SF down I-280, it goes through mostly vacant land. What stands in the way of building housing there?
        Actual sentence from the article: "Fortunately Ive is perhaps the world's most avid connoisseur of whiteness since Herman Melville"

        "Jobs hated air-conditioning and especially loathed fans. But he also didn't want people opening windows"
        Apple explains why workers can't set the office temperature: "part of being connected to the outside is knowing what temperature it is."

        But seriously props to @MalwareTechBlog, a right proper U.K. lad who did his part to save United States timezones from WCry ransomware.
        We convened an emergency IT meeting to figure if anyone was hit, a huge part of not being hit was @MalwareTechBlog registering killswitch
        24/7 American companies like FedEx went into lockdown due to WCrypt. That could have been tons of everyday companies if this wasn't killed.
        Make no mistake, the only reason we're making jokes about NHS security here in the States, is because American networks were spared.
        We're talking tens, hundreds of millions of dollars, saved because our colleagues in Europe took the full hit, and found a countermeasure.
        I'm being conservative because I'm not an economist.WCry could have arguably cost the US a billion dollars or more depending on networks hit
        If WCry locked the networks of public transportation and logistics providers... I really don't know how far the costs could go.
        You're probably right. In a past life I did economic impact analysis of disasters. Large corps hourly revenue easily adds up
        Not to mention the productivity lost of all the patients. It's turtles all the way down.https://twitter.com/cstross/status/864531381929508864 ... 
        I remember when my company way back got hit by code red. It shut us down for almost two weeks. They literally had to swap ppls laptops out.
        Just to get us back up and running, they had a table with a stack of laptops and a line of people handing one on and taking another.

        "If we set a truckload of money on fire, people will pay admission to watch!" Silicon Valley is still mastering the concept of revenue
        Public understanding of worm technology is primitive because we haven't thought we needed it...
        Everyone thought systems got "secure" after Microsoft's big security push. More realistically, hackers had other things to do.
        We may look at the last two decades as "The time in between major rampant worms everywhere"...
        Everyone ignored what stuxnet and flame showed them, imho.
        The tools everyone invested in were sniffers and scanners...but there IS another way. That way is self-replicant programs.
        Did no one else read the Long Run?
        We have no conceptual defenses against mutating worms or hydras that attack multiple platforms, or the complex emerging info attacks...
        But that doesn't mean there aren't people working on advanced self replicating systems. You think NK is the world leader?

        You can be concerned about both Trump-Russia links and about Dems' war-themed Russia rhetoric creating the environment for a war.

        The way to make money with a ransomware worm is clearly just buying a ton of HACK or infosec stock. FEYE up 7%.
        North Korea used an NSA exploit stolen by Russia to deploy malware that ransoms data in exchange for cryptocurrency.
        The suggestion that governments should find bugs and turn them over to the IT industry reminds me strangely of the finance industry ...
        ... generating excess profits while exposing society to excess risks and then forcing taxpayers to bail them out without loss of equity.
        (I was not opposed to a bailout of the banks, because not bailing them out would have been catastrophic, but central-bank sponsored ...
        ... bailouts should lead to the taxpayer owning the equity thereafter)

        A flaw in the ransomware hack
        The WCRY authors seem not to have planned for scale, and can't serve paying customers. Sounds like United Airlines is behind this.
        if true, this could be almost as serious as having an email server.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html ... 
        Folks, the real story here is who leaked this sensitive information to the Fake News Washington Post.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html ... 
        Interesting tidbit in here https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?tid=sm_tw&tid=sm_tw&tid=sm_tw&tid=sm_tw&tid=sm_tw&tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.a3d20f116ef4 ... 
        Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!
        I hope there's a contingency plan in place for when he starts a sentence with, "I have the best launch codes... "
        Now might be a good time to subscribe to the Washington Post. https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com 
        Terrible OPSEC. Any intel professional would tell him you pass secrets to the Russians with dead drops and brush passes, not in your office.
        The President merely shared intelligence with one of his closest allies. Totally routine.
        Remember 2016 and how that was the weirdest year ever?
        This is like the deleted scenes that didn't make the 2016 final cut.
        Remember when Trump bragged he could get away with shooting someone on Fifth Avenue? Maybe stay away from Fifth Avenue for a while.
        What if the Post got played today, in a move to discredit journalism? Unlikely, IMO, but news orgs have to be super-wary of this tactic.
        The president seems to really like bragging to Lavrov, so maybe the guy could ask him to talk about his tax returns?
        We told you the President would show his intelligence, and he delivered.
        Note that McMaster says only that sources and methods weren't DISCUSSED, not that they weren't revealed or exposed.pic.twitter.com/iXiEqahrCW
        "Discussed" seems to be a particularly carefully chosen word, along with all the other carefully chosen words.
        By the way, another good time to carefully choose words is when you're talking about sensitive information with an adversary.
        This is, of course, entirely plausible, though it's also what you'd leak to take heat off a less staunch ally with less public sharing.https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/864534936358981632 ...

        So Proximus (largest Telco in BE) seems down in most of Belgium. No more phone/data. What are the odds this is #WannaCry related?
        This was bound to happy: instead of a kill-switch, the new ransomware uses an "enable switch" as a domain registration.https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/864416538518007808 ... 
        Update: it's back, roughly ~30min outage judging by my phone. Which is a totally scientific measurement.
        The three bitcoin wallets tied to #WannaCry ransomware have received 233 payments totaling 38.06273688 BTC ($64,472.33 USD).

        One reason it's hard to predict the future is that developments depend on other developments. So error accumulates very rapidly.
        Subtle tip: Say "a series A" rather than "our series A." The latter weakens you by making it seem like it has to happen.
        We consistently attribute too much meaning to things to do with Trump.
        We look for reasons behind his election and strategies behind his actions, when the answers are probably fluke and impulse respectively.
        Seeing more pattern than exists is an innate human flaw, but the Trump presidency really brings it out.
