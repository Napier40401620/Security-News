        How great is this? 1password introduces a travel mode. One more great reason to use them https://blog.agilebits.com/2017/05/18/introducing-travel-mode-protect-your-data-when-crossing-borders/ ...  (thanks @waxpancake!)
        If you are an NGO and would like help rolling out 1Password and 2FA to your users, reach out; we can help make that happen.https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/867084218022719488 ... 
        1Password remains the only password manager I recommend largely w/o reservation. You can lose security w/ a bad password manager.
        If you're an NGO or public interest organization in Chicago, I can do better than help: I'll bring tokens and licenses with for your org.
        (that's probably true in a couple other cities too)

        Trump would have people extrajudicially murdered like Duerte in a heartbeat if he could, and 35% of Americans would cheer.
        I don't know if you all follow @Popehat but there is some crazy shit going on right now about Sean Hannity and cats. Next Fox shoe dropping.

        You could read this, or, better yet, just take everyone's word for it that Louise Mensch and Claude Taylor are full of shit.https://twitter.com/cjane87/status/867140812160860160 ... 
        Huh? If that's the case, Trump is to blame, because Duterte's administration published it. What, you think DPRK needed NYT to read it?https://twitter.com/NoahCRothman/status/867373361755770880 ...
