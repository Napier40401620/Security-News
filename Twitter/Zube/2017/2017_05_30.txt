        Then there are plots that don't get quite as much attention, like the guy who called the KKK and wanted to fry muslims with microwave beams.
        The KKK also reported him to the FBI. Turns out they don't have death beams.
        Point is, people in established organizations don't want to fuk with some nutter who wants to kill people and make them look bad.

        But it is indicative of an agency with wide discretion to pursue domestic threats without need to immediately weigh individual investment.
        I have no sufficiently informed opinion, but it is an extremely interesting mental exercise, and little-understood by the wide public.

        New Microsoft Office update has this stupid "background" task  which opens a CMD window then closes it again really quickly...every hour.
        I mention this now, as we're starting to see the first papers published at top tier academic conferences that do exactly that
        Somewhat trite, but 'you build what you measure' is as applicable to research communities as it is to companies.
        I would argue that 'no source code release + eval on synthetic programs only' should be an auto reject from academic conferences
        With both of those attributes the claims are unverifiable without a full reimpl but doing that is a huge gamble when the tests are synthetic

        BA boss said backup systems failed. To even get that far / talk of that is bad. Primary systems - whether Sysplex or not - shouldn't fail
        The problem is companies rarely do prod runs on their backup systems so of course outages occur despite 'testing'.

        I wonder if, as the biological basis of intelligence becomes better understood, it will start to seem wrong to call people stupid.
        Right now, the most self-consciously virtuous people have no problem calling e.g. Trump dumb or stupid.
        But I can easily imagine our descendants 100 years from now wincing at our shocking unPCness in using such words.
