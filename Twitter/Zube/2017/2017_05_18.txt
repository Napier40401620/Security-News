        Is Trump worse than Nixon or Reagan? No, because neither of those two faced such early hostility from the mainstream. Quite the opposite.

        So much confusion in the patch responsibility convo. Maybe a breakdown of issues in institutional, server, embedded, desktop, mobile envs.
        All these environments suffer from vulnerabilities and patch friction, but the exposures, constraints, opportunities, and risks vary wildly.
        I'm interested in the organizational behavior issues and how to resolve them, and if/how regulation/policy can nudge vendors and clients.
        I'm less interested in individual ("patch your g-d system!") and more interested in ecosystem evolution and improvement.

        Though the kill-switch stops #wannacry from running, the worm function is still very active. More than 3k attempts per minute to spread...pic.twitter.com/tFHRxX3QQE
        This is already known, but bears repeating. Though the killswitch stops #wannacry, it checks every 10 minutes to see if its still there.

        I was able to use a sealed envelope addressed to a coworker containing a credit card to buy myself a slurpee thanks to the wonders of NFC
        It's sent in an unmarked envelope, but I could tell which bank it's from by googling the GPO Box return address on the back
        And that's why here in Austria you have to use the card once "physically" before you're able to use NFC.
        Same with UK cards, have to use Chip+PIN at a terminal once before Contactless payments will work.
