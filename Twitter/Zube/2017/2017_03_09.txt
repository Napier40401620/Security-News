        Excited to announce I'm joining Didi Research America to lead the safety and security of their autonomous transportation systems.
        My job is to make sure the assisted driving and autonomous systems developed and used by Didi are resistant to external attacks and threats.
        Thrilled to be working w/a lot of very talented engineers here in California and in China. Interested in securing the future?  We're hiring!
        For those who asking what Didi Research America is, it's a research lab in the US for Didi Chuxing, see for example:https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/didi-chuxing-uber-china-ride-hailing-global/ ...

        Tech is a huge refuge for trans women, so we need to get our shit together to welcome them as women and human beings #InternationalWomensDay
        Trans women are engineers, managers, speakers, and open source maintainers. Tech owes them deeply. #InternationalWomensDay
        the only good male feminists I know just have a bunch of interesting women in their lives and shut the fuck up about it
        For #internationalwomensday I want to tell you about Dr Martine Rothblatt (cont'd)
        Dr Rothblatt is the creator of SiriusXM, the revolutionary satellite media company. She is also a certifiable genius.
        Dr Rothblatt conceived of and mathematically proved the first electric-powered full-size helicopter flight. She's retained by NASA.
        Dr Rothblatt is the highest paid female CEO in America.
        When Dr Rothblatt's daughter was diagnosed with a life-threatening disease, Rothblatt taught herself biochemistry and founded a biotech firm
        Dr Rothblatt is a currently trying to preserve her wife's consciousness so she can transfer it to a robot.
        Dr Rothblatt has been featured in countless publications, from Forbes to the Washington Post. Here's her TED talk:https://www.ted.com/talks/martine_rothblatt_my_daughter_my_wife_our_robot_and_the_quest_for_immortality ... 
        And Dr Martine Rothblatt is a trans woman.
        So, why isn't Dr Martine Rothblatt a household name? Why don't we know about her instead of Elon Musk?

        New blog post: "Wikileaks, the CIA, and the Press": https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/blog/2017-03/2017-03-07.html ... 
        A friend (who'd know) points out that it's unsurprising that CIA tools focus on endpoint exploits, since they (unlike NSA) don't do SIGINT.
        All in all, reading too much into a single snapshot of one set of tools from one agency is a recipe for being badly mislead.
        After all these leaks, one thing that remains mostly a big question mark is NSA's cryptanalytic capability. Almost nothing leaked about it.
        Can NSA break, say Signal encryption? I doubt it. But I don't know.
        What is likely is to extent that NSA CAN break modern crypto apps, it's more due to app-specific implementation that broad cipher failures.
        Anyway, you can now return to tying today's news into whatever shape knot you need it to be in to support your political position.
        Looked up from overblown infosec news to find politician saying poor folks shouldn't have phones. Going back to overblown infosec story.

        WikiLeaks' CIA dump came with a huge dezinformatsiya campaign that seemed poised and ready to exploit it.  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/08/who-s-behind-the-massive-cia-leak.html ...  #Vault7

        FDR's message to Congress on Curbing Monopolies. http://bit.ly/2mldEQA  Your daily reminder. h/t @matthewstoller
        This data is fascinating. 39% of union households approve of Dems, 50% disapprove. Pence is at 47% and 35%.https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/839306502900969472 ... 
        Democratic Party is less popular than GOP and Trump. And Pence blows everyone away.https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/839306502900969472 ... 
        This by @matthewstoller, btw, is excellenthttps://thebaffler.com/salvos/hamilton-hustle-stoller ... 
        Wow. @SenatorTomUdall asks @AjitPaiFCC if he agrees w/ Trump that media is enemy of the American people. Pai won't answer. #SenateCommerce
        The Democratic party is unpopular b/c their ideas are weak and irrelevant. Change the ideas ==> more popular.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/839508779737706497 ... 
        The Democrats should be saying 'let's go after high pharma, hospital prices'. Instead they are letting Trump steal that issue.
        If Trump does something about high pharma prices, which is a big if, it will make the whole ACA repeal fight less damaging to GOP.
        But the executive branch has the authority without Congress to attack high pharma prices. And there is Congressional interest in PBMs.
        It's true, there is no consensus among Democratic leaders on this. Many don't believe gov't has a role in pricing.https://twitter.com/LibertyBlitz/status/839514780503244802 ... 
        And Obama had eight years and did nothing on it except allow prices to rise. So... that's the policy. High prices.https://twitter.com/Drisco9/status/839515401742614528 ... 
        Actually not a corruption problem. Half of Dems just don't *believe* in interfering with pharma's pricing.https://twitter.com/nathanhulickcpa/status/839515508068188160 ... 
        And it's not just the leaders. A majority of Dem voters will not vote their reps out who support big pharma. "I'm a moderate... etc"
        This is the constant hectoring you get when you talk about the ideology and harm of big money.https://twitter.com/sci_writer/status/839516457000120320 ... 
        Mexico is starting to halt exports to the US because there is no one at Dept of Commerce to work with. We have no Govt. It'll get worse.
        Unfavorable rating for Democratic Party continues to grow. http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/democratic-party-favorable-rating ... pic.twitter.com/0cH7EpAqv6
        So there was apparently no policy reason to include the deeply unpopular individual mandate but Obama did anywayhttp://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/8/14849512/death-spirals-experts-republican-health-care-bill ... 
        in 2010 I repeatedly said Obama experts were being dishonest about how "alternatives" to the mandate wouldn't work and I'm proven right.
        At present the "Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2017" is sponsored by more Republicans than Democrats https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1227/cosponsors ... 
        This is true. But the good news: if you click your heels and say "Comey" & "Putin" & "Susan Sarandon" & "NYT" enough times, it disappears.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/839511371993722881 ...

        If you're paranoid enough to leave your phone outside, don't have your secret conversation in front of *any* internet connected microphone
        Also don't pretend that putting glue in your laptop's microphone will work, the codec can be reconfigured to have speakers work as inputs

        https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/839154582970335232 ...  suggests that free software is inherently more resistant to state attack than proprietary software. This is untrue.

        Free software is necessary to ensure users are protected, but it is not sufficient. To imply it is without giving more context is dangerous.
        We gain control over our software not merely by ensuring that we control it, but by ensuring that others cannot. There's a long way to go.

        More concerning. #Vault7 cyber weapons similar to Equation Group weapons "shadow brokers" were trying to sell online https://web.archive.org/web/20160816004542/http://pastebin.com/NDTU5kJQ ... pic.twitter.com/acrBBO4w66
        Think of the brevity of these tools being in the wild.  Instead of the CIA hacking your phone, its an employer, an abusive partner, etc. 
        Nailed it. As much as I'm interested in the CIA's exploit archive, "Who leaked it and why?" is a question I can't stop mulling over.https://twitter.com/ncweaver/status/839167734650810368 ... 
        Whether haplessness or pervasive exfiltration led to this, we've opened a new chapter of freelance abuse of pernicious hacking tools #Vault7pic.twitter.com/QlMTtxPCqm

        @wikileaks Can you point us to the source doc that confirms this? Have been unable to find any docs that mention Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp

        In terms of the classification level of the documents spilled by WikiLeaks today, there's nothing as sensitive as what Snowden leaked.
        2/ The highest level of classification I've seen so far is Secret NOFORN-- the classification lvl of anything w/ someone's name on it at CIA
        3/ They even classified the how-to for setting up Visual Studio as Secret NOFORN. Because it had someone's name on it.
        4/ Lawfare says there are 2 docs marked TS. https://www.lawfareblog.com/cias-no-good-very-bad-totally-awful-tuesday ... 
        5/ I've found them. One is a single sentence about crypto  techniques. The other is a paragraph about jailbreaking/rooting phones in lab.
        6/ This is not to say that there will be no butthurt as the result of this leak. It points, at a minimum to mishandling of sensitive info.
        7/ I'll have more detailed analysis tomorrow on @ars, but it appears WikiLeaks has wildly overstated and sensationalized this leak.
        8/ and lol I mean @arstechnica not @ars.
        No man, EVERYONE DID.https://twitter.com/oscaron/status/839166572409339904 ... 
        so this is kinda wonderful...

        The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption.
        The story isn't about Signal or WhatsApp, but to the extent that it is, we see it as confirmation that what we're doing is working.

        The only way the GOP healthcare plan could be worse for Trump's voter base is if it let insurance companies charge white people more
        Really the only losers under the GOP's Obamacare replacement are the old, the sick and the poor plus anyone who's not a health insurance CEO
        "Why should I have to pay for other people's healthcare?" ask people with insurance who don't understand what insurance is

        Yes. Wikileaks does just this & it works. Passed off random email lists as "Turkey AKP emails"--it worked. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/839204691305181184 ...
