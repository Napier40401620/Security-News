        Moby Dick is the reason I tried clam chowder for the first time, true story. It's an entire chapter in the book.
        Also Queequeg is like "I prefer to eat people, but clam chowder is delicious."
        Seriously you know you want an Ahab service. Stop a container with 'ahab harpoon <ID>'
        If the container process won't stop, the ID will be highlighted in white and become an analogy for man's existence

        pour one out for MIT's net18. just sold a big chunk of the 18.0.0.0/8 ipv4 address space to amazon to fund migrating the university to ipv6.
        So, https://dnsspy.io/  is interesting but I disagree with some recommendations...  for example this idea that you should have an IP... 
        for your "apex zone", i.e. the naked domain. Why? This is just an aberration linked to the loss of www but if you haven't got a website? ... 
        next aberration is the recommendation to have a www address. Why? Then we move to the more technical: if all your NS are in the zone then... 
        you get a warning because if your zone disappears so do the name servers...  what? I believe in @davidmpick who taught me the importance of... 
        DNS and the efficiency of not having recursion when looking for NS records. If .org disappears then, frankly, your http://example.org ... 
        remains unreachable whether or not you have name servers all in your zone or not 'cos you cannot recurse from root... 
        some recommendations are either modern absurdities (like A for zone) or outright misconceptions.

        I don't think "overall bug collision rate" is useful. But "bug collision rate in small, important attack surface", e.g. Broadcom WiFi: yes.
        Read the linked article.https://twitter.com/charlvdwalt/status/854954318243536899 ... 

        Thoughts about writing tough exploits: (1) Every time I try to cut corners and not understand something, it returns to bite me weeks later.
        (2) A lot of time is spent in cognitive dissonance. "According to my understanding of the world, this can't happen. But it does. Why?".
        (3) One of the frustrating bits is "knowing that it is possible, but not knowing how exactly".
        (4) Few things teach you about the intricacies of a code base like trying to abuse it.
        (5) I have avoided to repeatedly exploit the same target to maximize learning in life - but it really also maximizes pain.

        Reducing @VessOnSecurity to one sentence: AV cannot detect it because "halting problem" therefore it must be new malware.

        The reason why it is called "new" malware is that it gives them an excuse to not detect it.https://twitter.com/raistolo/status/855062977971617793 ... 
        So you say that AV offers no protection if you understand how the product works?

        Good idea for new domains. Automatically consider them no-mail domains to prevent abuse (with SPF -all, empty DKIM-key, DMARC p=reject). 1/2
        Domain owner has to change settings if he wants to send mail. For DMARC/SPF/DKIM settings for no-mail domains: https://www.m3aawg.org/sites/default/files/m3aawg_parked_domains_bp-2015-12.pdf ...  2/2
        DANE for SMTP (RFC 7672) scales and its usage is growing steadily:
        ICYMI: @DnsSpy by @mattiasgeniar will check & score your DNS data. Increase effectiveness & security, check outhttps://dnsspy.io/ 
        1) imho @DnsSpy, I would say no grade A for anyone without a correctly signed DNSSEC zone.
        2) IF MX records exist, then A+ for valid SPF|DMARC|DANE TLSA entries for those hosts.
        ... or am I getting too far outside the scope of DNS checks? :-)
