        Minor bug in New 2DS XL firmware? System Update in System Settings says "Update your Nintendo 3DS system". Old 2DS says 2DS. #3DS
        One of the few remaining mysteries of the #3DS to me is how "kiosk" units are programmed to turn off only when AC power is removed.
        Such activity is clearly controlled by the MCU, but there is no evidence so far that kiosk units have a different MCU from retail.

        1/ I think words are misleading... We still call MD5 a 'cryptographic hash', albeit broken. During my recent collisions experiments...
        ...and also the hashquines - see PoC||GTFO 14 https://archive.org/details/pocorgtfo14 ...  - MD5 actually felt like... a toy: a fidget spinner of an algorithm...
        and yet people still use it for important things... is it because it's still listed as a   hash? and you can still 'import' it...
        with no huge 'DON'T DO THAT' warning on the screen?
        FTR, PoC||GTFO 14 contains 609 MD5 identical prefix collisions. so, out of 2Ë†609 files with the same MD5, we provided the 'right' one ;)
        also, 2Ë†609 is quite a big number. 184 decimals...pic.twitter.com/R7BuPZwSZ9
        my conclusion is: even if MD5 is broken in practice, it's still a damn nice fidget spinner ;)
        credits go to @teh_gerg @makomk @__spq__ @ESultanik @doegox @rogdham for the hashquines.
        and of course @realhashbreaker for turning MD5 into a fidget spinner.

        TRUE that. Nothing is "unhackable". Not to mention, anything claiming it is, will be #1 hacking target. Hackers like a challenge. :)
        "mathematically impossible to revert or hack data" very bold!
        They have a patent so it must be true. "unhackable, USPTO-patent
        looks like the claim is based on their use of blockchain, which we know is a good direction, but certainly not 'unhackable'
        2 email addresses, no twitter, lot of news. bad sign. if 'unhackable', should make their code public

        1. My unpopular opinion: political "teams" do bear some responsibility for political violence by members of their "team," even fringe ones
        2. By far the most important version of this is US politicians demonizing our rotating Enemy of the Day, which has gotten millions killed
        3. The next most historically important is incitement by white Christian US politicians against non-white and/or non-Christian Americans
        4. Ideally we'd require from all leaders a) no incitement, b) condemnation of any violence by their team & c) lowering the temperature
        5. Bernie Sanders has obviously never engaged in incitement & immediately condemned James Hodgkinson
        6. But Sanders can & should make an effort to tamp down the general political temperature on his team
        7. No other big time politicians do this & Sanders's team is better than most but Sanders still has the responsibility to try
        8. First, it's the right thing to do, esp. in a country with Facebook, 12 billion guns, no mental healthcare & people under extreme pressure
        9. Second, it's the strategic thing to do, because lefty politics will never win & thrive in an atmosphere of political violence
        10. I know this is frustrating & unfair since the ratio of right-wing to left-wing political violence in the US is at least 100-1
        11. And that's leaving out the far more vicious and common official, institutional violence
        12. Moreover, right-wing leaders engage in constant incitement and rarely if ever condemn violence by their team
        13. But most things about politics are unbearably frustrating, which is why I concentrate on naked mole ratspic.twitter.com/RiHXZGHX2N
