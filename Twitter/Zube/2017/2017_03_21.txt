        Pwn2Own is over https://blog.trendmicro.com/results-pwn2own-day-three/ ...  Some points of interest: top 5 players are from China, 3 of them from @TencentCorp.
        Also, in the old days it was one person or two or three people winning, now it is teams of people.  This is evidence exploitation is harder
        Also, no one hacked chrome.  It is very rare for a target to not get hacked at pwn2own.  So, chrome == unhackable now?
        Here is more of what I mean.  The winning team this year is larger than every winner of Pwn2Own combined for the first 6 years.https://twitter.com/elisal/status/842898355491487744 ...
