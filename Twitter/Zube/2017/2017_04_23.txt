        Excited to be marching for science tomorrow, but depressed to be in a world where we actually have to march for FREAKING SCIENCE.
        Interesting correlation: majority of trolls replying that "science shouldn't do politics" have bitcoin stuff in their profiles.
        I'm marching not so much because I'm a science type myself, but because I'm grateful I didn't die in a cholera epidemic or something.
