        Is a compilation a derivative work?
        Specifically: If someone asserts compilation copyright over something that includes a GPLed work, is that derivation or mere aggregation?
        Relevance: http://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2017/ancillary-rights.html ...  asserts that distributions have compilation copyright but doesn't seem to consider this issue
        Related: would a license that asserted that compilations containing the work must be released under the same license be free software?
        DFSG 9 says that a license may not contaminate other software distributed alongside it, but that's arguably only talking about aggregation

        Disinformation is the oldest infosec threat of all--the degrading of the quality of information can be more dangerous than leaks.
        Critical decision making is impossible when those tasked with the decision have had their point of view altered by disinformation.
        For example, let's say someone undertakes an information war to destroy faith at the exec level in US intelligence. Purely theoretical.
        A third party, through backchannels, could be feeding what appears to be quality info to an insider, and simultaneously embarrasing the IC.
        At a certain point, they start lowering the quality of information being fed indirectly, steering a certain POV, that clashes with IC data.
        The executive then has to decide, do I trust this previously reliable insider, or the IC institutions that have egg on their face?
        So the exec says to the IC, "just send me more raw data"--and then uses the backchannel to get analysis/verification. And scene.
        End result of this scenario: not just bad info, but exposure of sources and methods for good info.
