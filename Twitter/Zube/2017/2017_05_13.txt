        Facebook removed a Dutch women's organization's page for "promoting drug use." The drug is an abortion pill:http://www.newsweek.com/facebook-delete-abortion-pill-page-608059 ... 
        Facebook's implication that women are using abortion drugs recreationally reminds me of the famous Onion article:http://www.theonion.com/article/planned-parenthood-opens-8-billion-abortionplex-20476 ... 
        Why are decisions about what people can or can't say in Holland being made by a 1099 contractor in Palo Alto? Why does Holland stand for it?
        In places like Ireland, which has some of the most repressive abortion laws in the world, Women on Web are an important life line
        I hate to get all Chomsky, but Facebook is a textbook exercise in colonialism, where the resource being extracted and refined is attention

        The question has been raised ( https://youtu.be/RH5zhAiAiWo  ) but Facebook doesn't have representation in the Netherlands to hold accountable.

        Hey @bombfell, why are your ads showing up on a right-wing newsletter? http://idlewords.com/images/bombfell_ad.png ... 
        Trump fired his FBI director over Russia, suggests there are tapes, and it still gets less NYT acreage than the email non-event in October
        How long are we going to keep referring to audio recordings as tapes? Or did Trump go old-school with the Nixon setup? So many questions
        Audiophile president prefers the warmer tone palette and superior bass response of surreptitious recordings on reel-to-reel tape

        Something like this is incredibly significant, we've not seen P2P spreading on PC via exploits at this scale in nearly a decade.

        No this bug was patched back on March 14th and only impacts computers which haven't been patched and rebooted.https://twitter.com/breakingcreech/status/863080277647794177 ... 
        I need a fucking raise
        So, WanaCrypt0r 2.0 ransomware (the new WCry/WannaCry) is spreading like hell.
        Massive in multiple countries, but we can say it's worldwide now...
        It entered our network through an infected laptop. Once inside it spread like wildfire to other machines missing key updates
        Make sure your admins didn't turn off Windows Firewall. It would protect computers connected to non-domain networks from being infected.https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/856593826852597761 ... 
        It's on by default for a reason you arrogant fuckfaces.
        Spare the rod of god tweets, spoil the childish IT workers.

        So unfortunately it looks like my 2017 prediction of "attacks getting so bad that things near a breaking point" thing has started.
        Also, you can disable the inbound SMB rules on any servers that don't need file sharing before you can reboot them.
        The patch for MS17-010 was worked on for two months by Microsoft's best people. FUCK YOUR CHANGE APPROVAL PROCESS. INSTALL IT NOW.https://twitter.com/swiftonsecurity/status/855617796092420096 ... 
        My infosec prediction for 2017: reaching a breaking point. For some, DDoS, ransomware, and privacy concerns will grow too dire to ignore.
        Bad enough stuff will happen in 2017 that some people who kludge key infrastructure security will start getting a second look.
        FedEx confirms @SwiftOnSecurity's report that they're hit with SMB ransomware, and trying to control it.pic.twitter.com/nk8AgGLDS5
        Ransomeware attacks have become IT Security's tough love consequence. Spend nothing on IT? You'll spend it on BTC instead.
        Keep in mind that IT security failure is rarely the result of first-level admins. It's a business priority failure. My cursing isn't at you.
        We're eventually going to get whacked by this on unpatched systems, but want to emphasize you can limit the pain with proactive maintenance.
        A major industry person begged me to tell you all again, you need to patch MS17-010. They're seeing it and DOUBLEPULSAR freaking everywhere.

        The NHS has had several weeks to patch the Fuzzbunch attack. Doesn't look like many trusts have #nhscyberattack
        A map of the #nhscyberattack which is fully global https://intel.malwaretech.com/botnet/wcrypt  from @MalwareTechBlog
        If true, this means that 16 NHS trusts have been taken offline thanks to an exploit developed by the NSA
        When @myhackerhouse warned you to take MS17-010 seriously and apply fixes urgently and we were ignored. Now WCry is the Conficker 2.0!
        WCry will not be only malware team working on porting MS17-010 and friends into their code, apply those updates and remove those legacy box.
        How not to be hit by WCry 2.0: Apply MS17-010 immediately, remove NT4, 2000, XP-2003 from production, Firewall ports 445/139 & 3389. Simple.
        true story!  Those in the know updated!  ;-)  Great work BTW
        National Cyber Security Centre working with @NHSDigital & @NCA_UK to investigate "cyber incident" http://bbc.in/2pG21Dn  #nhscyberattack
        Remember when people were dismissive of MS17-010? then WCry 2.0 run-of-the-mill garden variety ransomware accidently does a #nhscyberattack... 
        Ahh so ~70% of clinically deployed OS in NHS running key legacy software. I believe those ports are used by a production EHR solution so...https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/863071532075143170 ...

        One of the biggest moral mistakes people make is to conflate how open to attack something is with how bad it is.

        The president fired the FBI director to obstruct a federal investigation into possible collusion with a foreign power to fix an election.
        Juicero was not created to head-fake people with a grudge against Silicon Valley into outing themselves, but it worked that way in practice.
        For a startup, growing slower is not always playing it safe, because it leaves you open to being picked off by a competitor.
        That said though, competitors are usually less of a threat than founders think.
        For every startup killed by a competitor, there are probably 100 killed by the founders' mistakes.
