        For the first time i bought a leather protection case and glass protection film for my iPhone today. Guy in Apple store had to redo film.
        When you fly from JFK to YUL where do you go through the canadian border check? JFK or YUL? (And where the other way around?)
        Looks like my Apple Watch suddenly cannot detect me standing anymore. It has only been one week since i have it...
        Since nobody asked the obvious question: do you guys shower together?https://twitter.com/taviso/status/860679110728622080 ... 
        And I thougth that vulnerability class was patented by Oracle/MySQLhttps://twitter.com/marcan42/status/860748153380667392 ... 
        LOL.https://twitter.com/_antcolony/status/860752152263770112 ... 
        It looks like a sunny day and voila my mood is already up several notches. I need to relocate to a more sunny location.
        @i0n1c and @bcrypt asking the tough questions
        did you take a bath this time?https://twitter.com/taviso/status/860679110728622080 ... 
        And I already see randos yelling at @taviso for dropping #microsoft 0-day on friday 
        Can you please shower earlier in the week?
        What type of shower do you own, and where can I get one?
        One of those ...https://twitter.com/dvk01uk/status/860724772828741632 ... 
        To be precise #MySQL had a vuln similar to #Intel #AMT in 2000/2002 #COM_CHANGE_USER http://www.e-matters.de/unternehmen/news/security-advisory-04_2002 ... 
        The #MySQL bug in 2002 was also funny: short response would allow trivial login bypass - long response would be a stack buffer overflow 
        Has anyone already brought up theory that timing of macronleaks is to make public believe dropping spool had no influence on US election...
        To clarify: Trump supporters can now claim: see #macronleaks didn't lose him election so shut up about #clinton

        YC innovation: paying for founders to fly to meet us. Other investors didn't do this; many of our best founders couldnt have come otherwise.
        Prediction: No startup run by a founder who is also running a fund on the side will be a big success.
        Starting a startup is one of the few tasks where inexperience is no barrier. Because if you do it right you get the experience en route.
        Do it right = the startup grows organically out of your own life (http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html ... ).
        Inexperience is an advantage in that you can garbage-collect obsolete components of conventional wisdom by failing to reproduce them.
