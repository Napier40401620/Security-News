        22/ For one, it was the FBI who called me a "FOIA Terrorist" & DOJ who said I was a member of a "FOIA posse."
        23/ I sue the govt in an effort to force govt agencies to be transparent b/c there is intense secrecy & agencies routinely violate #FOIA
        24/ Govt agencies refuse to abide by the law and respond to #FOIA requests. Journalists are left w/no choice but to sue.
        25/ Every #FOIA request & lawsuit I file is an effort to pry loose documents that would shed light on govt activity
        26/ That the US govt & NSA would file this motion and clearly try to imply I am a terrorist & nuisance is so disturbing.
        27/ But more importantly: what is the NSA hiding and why doesn't the agency want these IG reports to come out?
        28/ Perhaps some brave member of Congress who cares about transparency & the public's right to know will weigh in.
        29/ But in the meantime, read that 33-page motion and look at my body of work based on docs I obtained via #FOIA. All valuable contributions
        30/ *Ends*
        *Addendum* 31/ 2 yrs ago, @jasoninthehouse invited me to testify before his committee abt problems w/#FOIA. I agreed https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Leopold-Vice-Statement-6-2FOIA.pdf ...

        @realDonaldTrump There's just so much hypocrisy in this single tweet that I feel like bursting into laughter while barfing at the same time.
        Trump's new travel ban is shortsighted, mean and useless, but this time there isn't anything particularly illegal about it.
        Trump's Muslim ban isn't about keeping us safe. A president intent on keeping us safe wouldn't give ideological ammunition to terrorists.

        I need to apologize to the @nytimes, in my displeasure over a tweet I thought was automated, I was very rude to their social media team.https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/839161093184454657 ... 
        *signs out and sits in box*
        Every WikiLeaks release in the past few years is a sensational initial claim that is immediately undermined by follow-on reporting.
        screaming
        Q: Does anyone have a set of ready-to-go Exchange rules regular expressions to detect variant domain names of a company? @ExchangeGoddess
        Example:
        Wikileaks is as bad as the Guardian. Both are trying to discredit vital technologies for keeping users safe; don't play along.
        Reporters; if you want to report accurately on Wikileaks dump, I'll connect you to cryptographers & infosec experts. Anti-surveillance ones.
        My databases unfairly get audited every single year. I see that JSON files never get audited. I wonder why?
        The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption.
        The story isn't about Signal or WhatsApp, but to the extent that it is, we see it as confirmation that what we're doing is working.
        Ubiquitous e2e encryption is pushing intelligence agencies from undetectable mass surveillance to expensive, high-risk, targeted attacks.
        This is the ticket. You want a conclusion? CIA has to work to target devices, they can't just dial-in or tap a wire.https://twitter.com/whispersystems/status/839204973921501184 ... 
        This is the company that develops Signal, and whose technology is licensed in WhatsApp.https://twitter.com/whispersystems/status/839204754718932992 ... 
        You're worried about mass, indiscriminate, undetectable invasion of privacy? Your work has paid off, and you have the proof.
        This is a win for the 99.997%
        Except for the people murdered by the other percent because the CIA couldn't listen, of course. 
        Fact that the CIA doesn't need a cornucopia of 0day/crypto breaks reinforces that the security weakness isn't the app.
        Security isn't an impossible goal reserved for some elite with $2000 phones.
        The fact that "#Vault7" was released is proof it's worth far more as a political talking point than as any kind of technical weapon.

        Congrats to @Veracode on their acquisition! @chriseng, @dildog - I called @WeldPond this morning and he didn't mention a thing. Good #opsec!
        While every day my flu symptoms change slightly, the net entertainment value of being sick is negative.
        There is a proliferation of papers claiming ASAN is a hardening solution. A good thread to understand why it is not: http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/363 ... 
        http://cybersecurityventures.com/cybersecurity-500-list/#home/?view_1_per_page=500&view_1_page=1 ...  - drinking game: Pick a random product, try to read the product description with a straight face. Any emotion: Drink
        "CIA lost control of majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized 0-day exploits" https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/ 
        TIL NTFS alternative data streams are still a thing. Wow. Flashback to my youth.
        @halvarflake Extended attributes offer essentially the same thing on *nix. It's even supported within the Android and iOS app sandboxes.
        So the CIA dump is interesting, but ... call me jaded, but there is nothing truly surprising so far?
        Perhaps a weird question, but has WL filed bug reports to vendors for the 0day in question?
        The three fallacies of Germany's trade surplus: it's not exports,nor #Euro, but investment gap. My op-ed @ProSyn http://prosyn.org/V4c5xgP  #in
        Why does @heiseonline report 5k developers working on offense according to Vault7? Where in the leaks is that # from?
        Let me remind you that CIA classified AV exploits as NOFORN, aka to not be shared with non US intelligence partners!
        The AV crowd is unusually quiet today! Maybe they're surprised that CIA is actively exploiting them? Lol
        You can't have a secure Signal channel and browse the Internet on the same phone. It doesn't work.
        Interesting the amount of EFI info related to Macs.

        Can I put "website mentioned by CIA" on my CV?
        At least my slide saying that (U)EFI rootkits aren't unicorns isn't totally disconnected of reality :X
        I guess the .ru investigation in the US is getting too hot, time to throw a big distraction at the CIA; drive wedge between executive & IC

        I think now is the best time to advertise my upcoming iOS kernel exploitation trainings. I am about to book hotel for last week of June.
        LOL. I just learned that @osxreverser calls me cologne crying baby.
        I remember how much @osxreverser cried because one of my coworkers implemented a MacOS installer hash checker 
        So today's dump showed that CIA had a jailbreak for iOS 9.2 around January 2016?!?
        I think the most interesting column of that iOS exploit table is "persistence despite iOS update"
        I wonder if "block" means that CIA iOS malware disables OTA updates?!?
        Btw i think CIA calling the kext_request infoleak that Apple tried to fix 4 times ir0n1c if funny.
        Thanks to the CIA I got hundreds of new Twitter followers today. Welcome. You have no idea (yet) what you signed up for.
        Imagine Wikileaks had redacted my name. Everyone would still know about it because of the codename: ironic
        The CIA iOS leak also shows that when Apple doesn't fix bugs for real the first time around intelligence services will use them thankfully.
        I always wonder if Deutsche Bahn puts something into the air in ICE trains. Even a short 50 minute trip makes me tired as hell.

        Half my colleagues and students are immigrants or int'l visitors, including many refugees. Attacking immigration *is* attacking science.
        International collaboration has become an essential part of scientific and engineering research. Stop that and you stop progress itself.
        @mattblaze 100 of 350 US Nobel Prize winners overall were immigrants:https://theconversation.com/americas-nobel-success-is-the-story-of-immigrants-67219 ... 
        A typical US research lab must look like a dystopian hellscape to bigoted xenophobes. All those people with funny names, working together.
        Larger lesson of today's trove of (alleged) CIA hacking tools? Large software systems often have exploitable bugs, as everyone already knew.
        Security nuance alert: All sorts misleading reporting about implications of CIA hacking tools today. (1/)
        First, this appears to be about tools that target selected end users by compromising their phones, not that break the crypto generally. (2/)
        Apps (like Signal) depend not only on their own code for security, but on the platforms they run on (like iOS or Android). (3/)
        A weakness in EITHER the app itself OR the platform may be sufficient for an adversary to target a user and get their messages. (4/)
        Which means that if the CIA finds exploitable flaws in iOS/Android, ANY app (like Signal) running there might be able to be compromised (5/)
        The trove released today seems to be mostly about exploiting platforms. That's both bad news and good news for users. (6/)
        The bad news is that platform exploits are very powerful. The good news is that they have to target you in order to read your messages. (7/)
        These kinds of exploits don't just let them read everyone's traffic over the 'net at the push of a button. (8/)
        What can you do as a user to defend? Boring stuff. Keep your software up to date. Don't run unneeded apps. Don't become a CIA target. (9/9).
        You can yell at me all you want, but I still don't know how to reliably defend a modern phone against a state-level adversary.
        Also, what does this tell us about open- vs. closed- source?
        (Unsatisfying) bottom line: you can't be reliably secure against a state adversary, but it's still possible to improve security in practice.
        Actual experts tend to be quieter and less certain of things than someone who read the first 2/3rds of an article on some website once.
        Does government use of exploits raise hard questions? Yes.
        The lesson for users of encrypted apps like Signal, etc., isn't that these tools don't work, but to be aware of their limitations.

        The GOP should just repeal the capital gains tax hike, change the name Obamacare to Trumpcare and do nothing else. That's a viable strategy.

        @matthewstoller's hamilton essay in @thebafflermag is brilliant ! i learned a lot.https://thebaffler.com/salvos/hamilton-hustle-stoller ... 
        Taking on the Hamilton cult, in @thebafflermag, @matthewstoller quotes me yet goes beyond, to the 1800 election:https://thebaffler.com/salvos/hamilton-hustle-stoller ... 
        Amazing. The real Hamilton: an authoritarian in democrat's clothing. @matthewstoller's finest work ever, I reckon.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/839137501721804800 ... 
        Read this if you want to know about Alexander Hamilton's various attempts at militarily overthrowing the US gov't.https://thebaffler.com/salvos/hamilton-hustle-stoller ... 
        Weirdest thing about the Hamilton cult is that his loathing for democracy is not controversial. So what gives?https://thebaffler.com/salvos/hamilton-hustle-stoller ... 
        Reminder from @matthewstoller that Hamilton was bad:https://thebaffler.com/salvos/hamilton-hustle-stoller ...

        New GOP message: don't buy new phones, so it's easier for the government to compromise you
        Based on https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_13762785.html ...  I'm unconvinced that Weeping Angel was in a state where it could be used at the time of this dump
        It reads like a tech demo - it's clearly a statement of interest in this vector, but in the described state there's a real risk of discovery
        List of iOS exploits didn't get updated to include 9.0 until after 9.2 was out
        Could be latency in updates, could be that it took them at least 3 months to break it
        (always update your software)
        Lol (from https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_11629089.html ... )pic.twitter.com/LDMABHbOvC
        To be clear, this is a password for an external site, not an internal CIA password
        https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_2621481.html ...  is someone REing a Siemens desk phone. They're...  not very good at it.
        If there's a story here, it's that:
        The more I read this, the *better* I feel about the state of security. Android SELinux made things harder for the CIA!
        CIA have to resort to purchasing vulnerabilities for iOS!
        CIA didn't have an ASLR break for iOS 8 until @iOn1c released Ironic!
        Seriously it took this guy *over a month* to figure out what a driver does? https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_3375260.html ... 
        THE CIA SOURCE SHIT FROM R/NETSEC ON REDDIT https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_14587654.html ... 
        Ok https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_21561399.html ...  is interesting - FBI had a Chrome exploit that affected 41 basically at release time
        However, same page implies that CIA didn't have an Android 5 attack several months after release
        Of course, this could just be documentation not being updated in a timely manner
        (Same page says that FBI have a Galaxy S3 exploit, so if Trump *is* still running one... )
        Complete description of a vulnerability and exploit in Samsung's bootloader: https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/files/cadmium.pdf ...  - this redaction is *shit*

        Vault 7: CIA Hacking Tools Revealed - http://bit.ly/2mAFqd4 
        #Vault7 is another great example of why .gov-special key backdoored-crypto would be a disaster. Everything comes out sooner or later.
        If you prioritise reading the #Vault7 docs over securing your (clients) infrastructure, you're doing it wrong.
        Please stop spreading FUD about WhatsApp and Signal. The leak says CIA can haxor phones, not the apps or the encryption. This. Is. Not. New.
