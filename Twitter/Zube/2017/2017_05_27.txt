        That asswipe who won in Montana is a dying scream of reactionary white people. Their time is running out and they know it. But until then...
        Saw a guy (who resembled Dick Gregory) this morning wearing a red MAGA cap. As we crossed paths, I pointed to his cap and said "Seriously?"
        "Oh," he replied, touching the cap's bill. "Somebody gave this to me. I like it. It matches my jacket."
        "So it does," I said. We then went our separate ways.

        1/x Blaming PDF to kill data is just wrong - it's a rendered format!
        1 PDF with the article, nicely rendered, printable, etc... and one archive containing data (utopia)
        IMO it's not practical, but at least don't blame a print+standalone render format for not containing re-usable information.

        healthcare is hellishly inefficient. Medicare for all could and should be cheaper, but that means a lot of disemployment
        but with job placement, retraining, and industrial policy we can re-employ people whose jobs are no longer needed
        (and we can place new expanded bureaucracies in the old private healthcare-heavy locations)
        dream the dream. One day the US will spend more than 0.1% of GDP on active labor market policy
        it's a problem but it's solvable. we don't have to be forever held hostage to jobs doing pointless (or actively harmful) busywork
        and we also don't have to stand aside while certain cities get wrecked, like neoliberals of both parties did to the Rust Belt
        point is wonky types often make this seem harder than it is. it's really quite straightforward
        weird. can't imagine why....https://twitter.com/JoshuaMound/status/868163258871685120 ...
