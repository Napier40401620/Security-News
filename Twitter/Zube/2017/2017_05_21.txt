        I was reading about PCI Express on Wikipedia and it uses scrambling to avoid DC bias and EMI. Could an attacker choose bad data to break it?
        In the CD copy protection days, SecuROM 2.0 and Sega consoles used sectors that intentionally messed with the scrambler and EFM.
        I wonder whether an unprivileged attacker could, say, write files or textures with certain data patterns to mess with PCI-E hardware.
        As an example from SecuROM and Dreamcast, make a 10 MB 44100 Hz 16-bit stereo WAV file and replace data part with all 0x59s (ASCII "Y").
        Burn an audio CD with this WAV file, then try to read it back. You'll get read errors, or different data.

        1/ It's interesting that the three top law schools all have Internet/tech law centers with dozens of affiliated faculty from other schools.

        3/ At Harvard, it's the Berkman Klein Center, @BKCHarvard. You can see its Faculty Associates here: https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/faculty+associates ... 
        4/ At Stanford, it's the Center for Internet and Society, @StanfordCIS.  You can see its affiliate scholars here: https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people#affiliate-scholars ... 
        5/  Just idle curiosity here, but I wonder how all three ended up using the same model w/ lots of faculty "affiliates" at other schools.
        6/ And I'm also kind of curious if those at the schools see the affiliate relationships as significant, and if so what purpose they serve.
        7/ And yes, this is really just an excuse to avoid grading the large stack of exams here on my desk. :)

        Sales Dept needs to distribute constantly changing videos for offline play. Couldn't get wget to delete removed files, so wrote stupid hack:
        I turned on simple directory listing in Apache with htaccess, downloaded files with wget spidering based on the links in index.html.
        Turn on option in wget to convert the links in index.html to local links. So now folders have files + index.html with local index. Then
        I list the directory, grep the local index.html for the filename, and if it doesn't exist in the index anymore, delete the file.

        Trust people who are well-regarded by the people who *do* have real expertise. They tend not to like the sorts who mislead people on facts.
