        Thanks everyone for the ninja well wishes!  It cheers me up when otherwise I feel like throwing up ;)
        Ok I'm in signing in.  Saw a tester on the course take a huge fall.  Also found a dude less jacked than me :)

        Final American ninja warrior thoughts:  its crazy intimidating walking up to the course with all these people cheering.
        It was a fun experience, the crowd was super supportive, the other ninjas were really nice.  Wish I would have made it further :)
        The episode will air in June or July.  They may not use footage of me but I hope the do!

        Custom-machining the drivetrain cost a fortune, but it gave the Juicebro superior handling in wet, juicy conditions
        "Imagine a world where Juicero raised only $10M and built a product subject to significant constraints." Or even one where they raised $0M
        Juicebro's one unforgivable crime was removing the headphone jack

        Dear /r/netsec submitters, we appreciate that folks are scanning the Internet for DoublePulsar, but Internet-wide scanning is not technical.
        A technical analysis of the vulnerabilities themselves are suitable for /r/netsec, but scanning the Internet for $vulnoftheweek is not.

        it's a super simple modification, change 2 state variables, and change NonceSize to 8 instead of 12....
        actually, i'm a dummy, looks like you can just set the first 4 bytes to 0's and it will work the same, \o/ no modifications.

        Notice the careful line-breaking that ensures "your own computer" (then still a wonderfully novel idea) is one line.
        I can afford to subscribe to every site, but I never do. The reason is not the cost, but that subscribing is such a mess.
        I now assume all subscriptions (a) require too much work to sign up (b) autorenew and (c) deliberately make it hard to cancel.
        Existing publishers seem so wedded to their bad practices that solving the problem may require not just new tech but new publishers.

        If you find yourself writing "x doesn't need to be explained because it's familiar to everyone," it's a sign you need to explain it.
        If something truly doesn't need to be explained, the question of whether or not to explain it won't even occur to you.

        Current wishlist :
        Also, did a quick comparison with veil, msfvenom and @shellterproject. Results are quite interesting with Shellter.
        The only gripe i had was that in scenarios where extensive app whitelisting is there (eg. bit9), then powershell is ur only friend.
