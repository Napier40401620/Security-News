        Because the impt # isn't "what is overlap in vuln knowledge", it's "what is overlap in op capability", but the latter is v hard to measure.
        Also have to be a bit careful with estimates of exploit overlap; they have a nasty habit of overestimating, but v hard to measure.
        In other words, the VEP is all about this overlap.pic.twitter.com/z5AlN9CEb0
        The difficulty is measuring that overlap is hard because you need to know:

        This should give you an overestimate. You're essentially modelling public knowledge as an adversary and calculating its overlap with you

        "This is by reputation and track record the most aggressive office in white-collar crime in the country ever." Ok.https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/oct/10/preet-bharara-wall-street-defend-arrest-prosecute-bankers-crisis ... 
        So many people just want to believe bad reporting, they don't do research or think critically. They want fake heroeshttps://twitter.com/PatCDev/status/840559030892388352 ... 
        .@PreetBharara is not the worst prosecutor. He did some useful stuff. It just looks like he took orders not to go after the big guys.
        Maybe, maybe not. But why lie about it so aggressively? Why say you are the best that's ever lived?https://twitter.com/ColtonCanton1/status/840561826077298688 ... 
        Mary Jo White, who was a terrible corrupt SEC Chair, was picked b/c she was seen as a tough prosecutor. PR. She trained Preet Bharara.
        Neil Barofsky showed courage going after banks and opposing Geithner. Obama admin threatened him with personal ruin.https://www.amazon.com/Bailout-Account-Washington-Abandoned-Rescuing-ebook/dp/B00818J57W ... 
        It was pretty standard. Those who threaten power were undermined publicly or privately. Sometimes the campaigns worked, sometimes not.
        One big overstep was going after Aaron Swartz, who killed himself after prosecutor Carmen Ortiz was reckless.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carmen-ortiz-us-attorney-marty-walsh-prosecution_us_577a7ddce4b09b4c43c0e29a ... 
        If you're not close to the system, you don't see the sheer vindictiveness of these ppl. I was working on a project with Aaron when he died.
        Consumer spectators of politics don't see the personal choices. But remember these are people who make decisions. The myths are false.
        Here's the one other thing spectators don't get. These powerful people rely on you. They need you to believe. Or their power disappears.
        Obama was able to pursue bad financial policies not just because he was President, but because Democrats believed in him so much.
        Trump is constrained by distrust from the public. Clinton would've been similarly constrained. You don't have to believe. And that's power.
        The reason I'm an optimist is b/c voters are no longer believing in myth. They are catching on. Far more than partisan spectators and elites
        Barack and Michelle Obama lunch in NY with famous tax dodger Bono, diners applaud and cheer.http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/barack-michelle-obama-meet-bono-lunch-nyc-diners/story?id=46062675 ... 
        There are so few famous people that are for real in their politics. Cornel West, @johncusack, @mosesbread72, @timrobbins1, @susan_sarandon
        Most famous people are not willing to be *criticized* for challenging power. Most make anodyne Approved Political Statements.
        You don't like her or her opinions, fine. But she's honest about what she thinks. She's willing to be criticized.https://twitter.com/Batee555/status/840593571208142848 ...
