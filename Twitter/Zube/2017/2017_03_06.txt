        According to liberal logic, Putin financed a coup of the USG, but Obama, who expanded surveillance, would never wiretap Trump. Makes sense.

        @DidierStevens we can only use some kind of heuristics. I'll explain that in a post, too complex for a tweet.

        Instead of "redistribution," how about "fairer distribution of wealth"? Because wealth is already being redistributed--just mostly to the 1%.
        Which is why "wealth redistribution" is such a dumb/propagandistic phrase. Perniciously implies there's no current redistribution--to the 1%.

        Dear Twitter: If you just became a FISA expert via skimming Wikipedia, let me gently suggest slowing your roll. This shit is complicated.
        Having a hard time thinking of another example where a sitting (US) president openly accused his predecessor of interfering in the election.
        Also, impressive pivoting from attacking his predecessor to attacking a rival reality TV host.
        Remember those folks who assured us that Trump would calm down once he takes office? What other predictions do they have?

        Populism and Inequality?

        Trump isn't just the result of Clinton's campaign, Obama's policies, or media failures, but the collapse of the Bush wing of the GOP.
        New paper suggests that firms react to political risk by cutting investment & ramping up lobbying effortshttps://promarket.org/managing-political-risk/ ... 
        People should stop dancing around the fact that Trump is kind of, you know, an idiot. Racist and dangerous, yes. But also quite dumb.
        Yup. And also if wealth and intelligence are not correlated then maybe meritocracy's just a cover for class. Oh noeshttps://twitter.com/SeanWTreacy/status/838193294190465029 ... 
        Being stupid can actually be an asset in a candidate. You seem more trustworthy because you don't even know you're wrong or lying.
        Journalists have a very hard time writing that someone lied. But they have an even harder time saying someone powerful is actually stupid.
        Stupidity is not bad, and liberal fetishizing of intelligence and confusing of it with virtue is insufferable. It's just that Trump is dumb.

        Including the fact that it even exists. This is an entirely uncritical examination of abusive working conditions.
        Anonymous comment replying to 18-month old post to say that accusations of "Deepthroating Microsoft" are telling it like it is, not abusive
        "Work should be done upstream" versus "Linus will email you abuse if you work upstream" and people happy to defend that position

        The reason I can't stand watching presentations or listening to pitches is that they give sequential rather than random access.
        I'll put up with sequential access from a handful of great writers and filmmakers. From everyone else I want random access.
