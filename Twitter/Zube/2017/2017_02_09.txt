        No one who has hacked a car has given or taken car hacking training. Wanna learn? Read the 500+ pages written by @nudehaberdasher & I 4 free
        I'll post a link later to all the papers, but if you can't find them via google, I think your career as a car hacker will be short lived.

        Purcell is doing a much better job but let's not be too hard on Flentje: how would YOU do on the phone defending a morally repulsive order?
        Value of such live coverage is huge. Public education, transparency, all thanks to farsighted 9th Circuit practice started by Alex Kozinski
        I'm on the 1 train, but the fact that everyone is listening to a legal proceeding together like it's SHARKNADO is making me weepy.

        Trump will not be undone by his narcissism, greed, or racism, but because he's both lazy and unable to coherently delegate.
