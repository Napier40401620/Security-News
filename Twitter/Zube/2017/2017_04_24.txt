        "Lyft, FCA, Ford, Daimler, Tesla, and BMW also declined to comment on their cybersecurity measures for self-driving cars." Uber declined too
        Also, article says Justin Cappos, an NYU prof, got $1.4 million from DHS to secure cars.  Me and @nudehaberdasher got $0.  Seems smart.

        Reason why "both" isn't the right answer (though it is the most obvious one) is bc I'm also planning on riding 35 miles tomorrow.
        In retrospect the answer was obvious: the folks who're coming to dinner were JUST in the keys so rhubarb it is.

        Had a great time with thousands of other nerds who also lacked the good sense to come in out of the rain at the DC #ScienceMarch.
        The President is such a kidder. He almost had me going with that one.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/855859245023211520 ... 
        I honestly feel bad for the people on the Placebo March who thought they were at the Science March but double blind testing is important
        For those bothered by the turnout for today's #MarchForScience, you can always hold a March for Superstition and Ignorance if you want.
        Wait, I turn by back and the Surgeon General was fired, apparently because he has the crazy idea that gunshot wounds are bad for you,
        And the acting Surgeon General isn't actually a physician.
        Surgeon General is a relatively quiet position, but can carry significant weight. E.g., SG Terry's tobacco warnings, Koop urging condom use.
        My mom had Polio too. Please vaccinate your children!https://twitter.com/GladstoneInst/status/855833137628143616 ... 
        It didn't take long for the critics of the climate march to hit the "I'm rubber, you're glue" stage of enlightened discourse.
        Not so much mad scientists as bemused scientists.
        The anti-science people think "arrogant scientists think they're always right" when actually that's the opposite of how science works.
        "Trust me I'm a scientist" is really "Don't trust me, here's some evidence".
        Do individual scientists all live up to this ideal? Of course not. But the model has worked for a LONG time.

        At the point in my life where I'm shitposting Achewood to my parents
        This is one of the most weirdly passive aggressive commercial statements I've ever readpic.twitter.com/HIz2gi9aKb
        Here is the secret to computing: write in the language you feel good writing in, the rest is fungible
        Write in PHP. Write in Javascript. Write something that demonstrates your ability to make a computer do something other people want it to.
        Write code that has the social impact you desire, not code that impresses people you think you need to impress.
        Everyone has strong impressions about what the right language is. History has proven most of them wrong.
        Prologue for the following content: I'm a pretty successful computer person. I have no idea what I'm doing.
        I have literally no formal training in computer science. I've failed an interview at a well known company because I didn't big O notation.
        I fell into where I am almost entirely by luck. I was working on the right thing at the right time.
        But if people had told me that I'd never achieve anything unless I wrote in the right language with the right framework, I'd be fucked.
        Being in the top 1% of a language's users is relevant if you're writing a compiler for that language. Otherwise, fuck it.
        What's relevant is your understanding of broad concepts, not your understanding of monads (I have no idea what a monad is)
        Think about your users, write something they want, listen to people around you who have suggestions on how to do it better. That's all.
