        We are fundraising to get iPhones for the National Immigration Law Center so their staff can communicate securely:https://nilc.z2systems.com/np/clients/nilc/campaign.jsp?campaign=91&fundraiser=43703& ... 
        Unfortunately, the more secure iPhone are expensive. The NILC has agreed to switch over, but they need our help:https://nilc.z2systems.com/np/clients/nilc/campaign.jsp?campaign=91&fundraiser=43703& ... 
        If Google could be bothered to design a secure phone (or ask Apple for help), we wouldn't need these fundraisers. But they don't, so we do
        If you are curious about the technical reasons an organization like NILC need iPhones, there's a good summary here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9f789aabd7e8681dec0cf5781aecf664 ... 
        Getting tech people to come outside on a sunny day yesterday was a bridge too far, but I hope you'll consider donating to the phone drive
        The NILC is on the front lines of fighting the travel ban, deportations and worse. They don't have the budget for more secure tech--but we do
        If anyone works at Apple and can straight up donate some new phones to staff at the NILC, I'm happy to matchmake. Let's get them secured

        Say the phrase "venture-backed vegan food company" outside of California and you can actually hear the sound of wallets snapping shut
        Part of Hampton Creek's problem is that Silicon Valley already funds a vegan mayonnaise: it's called Soylent
        Hampton Creek, who sell fake mayonnaise at a loss, raised $120M. Signal, a secure messenger that saves lives, can't raise the $10M it needs
        Signal should more prominently advertise that it's egg-free, and maybe add support for a laundry mangle. Then the money would flow in

        Oh my god this is crazy.
        Reason GOP is breaking your bigCo employee health plan, shortened:
        They want to let states opt out of the toothiest parts of Obamacare. 
        Large employee health plans operate across stand lines.
        Without caps, if you have a kid and they end up in the NICU, you'd be bankrupted pretty much instantly.
        Anyways bigCo insurance caps apply only to essential health benefits.
        That didn't matter under Obamacare, because all states had to adhere to Obamacare's minimum essential health benefits (EHBs).
        Guess what the GOP's AHCA bill repeals?
