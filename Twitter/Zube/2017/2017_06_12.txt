        I lobbied for the backlink! And sure, make it optional for the "'muh scrolling" people. But don't forget it solves a problem YOU don't have.

        Or are they just betting no one will complete the 3-page form, upload the necessary documents (in correct file format, please!)?
        If so, douchebag move. Not easy to complete those things, have to shrink images etc. Elderly are bound to fall for the "50eur" scam.
        Creates for a good sales pitch in the shop though:"oh don't look at the price, you can get your money back". Meanwhile, they've got your $$.
