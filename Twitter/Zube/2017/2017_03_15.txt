        HEY I NEEDED THAT HOUR
        Steve Case continues to be a reliable bellwether for bad ideas. Here's a condescending bus tour:https://www.wired.com/2017/03/hey-coastal-elites-dont-dis-flyover-country-fund/ ... 
        I don't really understand why this idea that startups need to reach out to "forgotten america" takes such a powerful hold on silicon valley
        For starters, their "forgotten America" seems to be white Midwesterners. But there's plenty of "forgotten Americans" right next door to SV
        More important, there's no amount of startup funding or entrepreneurship that is going to create broad, stable employment and a safety net
        California, home of Silicon Valley, has the highest poverty rate in the country. Maybe startup culture is worth fixing before we export it
        Tech companies are sitting on giant piles of money sitting uselessly offshore. That money could do so much good work in the Central Valley
        The idea that there is some West Coast snobbery against "flyover country" is also a strange conceit. People here come from all over the map
        To my ears, too much of this talk is "people voted for Trump, so let's work to make them happy". You don't beat bigotry by rewarding it
        @Pinboard The idea of flyover country is a view I've heard from New Yorkers, never from Californians.
        @Pinboard I'm a third generation Oaklander. I can do local snobbery like you have never seen before!
        Tech Solidarity is TONIGHT at Grace Episcopal on Dearborn at 7PM. You don't have to be a "member", just show up. https://techsolidarity.org/events/chicago_march_13.html ... 
        We'll have speakers tonight from CAIR-IL, the Domestic Violence Legal Clinic, and a briefing on FOIA. +Stan's Donuts https://techsolidarity.org/events/chicago_march_13.html ... 
        This is maybe not the best wording for this tweet, but it reveals a lot about Effective Altruism:https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/836457674254344194 ... 
        If you donate to a fund supporting the 'long-term future', be aware you're most likely funding a weird AI religion: https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future ... 
        @Pinboard also if you're alive right now and pay for technology you're probably indirectly supporting some form of AI Scientology

        Legit asking: has Clinton, any of her aides or any top Dem publicly accepted any responsibility for losing the election to a reality star?
        Maybe cradle-to-grave socialism for the rich, and creative-destruction capitalism for everyone else isn't working all that well.
        Democrats concerned voters may expect them to stand for somethinghttp://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/governors-races-democrats-rift-235951 ... 
        Maybe the Acela corridor political class expressing surprise that voters are so angry perfectly exemplifies why voters are so angry.
        Maybe Dem "moderates" got crushed in the South because their corporatism made them seem indistinguishable from the GOP on economic issues.
        Overton Window = Dems basic argument now being "We must take back Congress so we can legislate policies as progressive as Gerald Ford"

        I can't shake the feeling that our societal order and capitalism are based on some subtle misunderstanding. Seems more bug than feature.
        I also dont know why so much effort is put into debating/measuring bug collisions vs "what % of bugs was avoidable through a bit of sanity"
        Coz seriously: guessing that 80% of vulns could be avoided by attack surf reduction & stronger sandboxing. But hey, lets not discuss this...
        .. because that brings us dangerously close to thinking that powerful economic interests should be responsible for shipping broken code.

        "I don't like the masters of the universe being mean. I will ask them nicely to stop and if they don't I will send a sternly worded letter."
        I mean what's the alternative? They are the masters of the universe. Who's going to run a big bank? You? Him? That random woman? Ha!
        It's why the masters of the universe hate Elizabeth Warren so much. She has a will to power. She knows their business better than they do.
        Elizabeth Warren realizes the masters of the universe are just men in suits. Take off their suits and they are just as naked as anyone else.
        This isn't just a problem for Dem elites. Half of Dem voters do not believe in wielding public power. They want sternly worded letters.
        Democracy is scary and requires personal responsibility. It requires wielding power and making mistakes. It requires calling out grifters.
        Better to heckle from the cheap seats and point at your sternly worded letters. Anyway that's the thinking. It's over.
        Young people are over this. They saw the bailouts and know those guys are naked under their suits. It takes time to change the institutions.
        Senator Klobuchar is on fire in her speech on antitrust. Goes straight at Bork's price frame.
        Wow Klobuchar just called the FTC divestment strategy a failure.
        Klobuchar says 'we need the agencies to do more'. Now talking Trump antitrust. He's been both a plaintiff and a defendant in antitrust.
        Trump was both a plaintiff and defendant in #antitrust cases.

mjg59

        dd-wrt topped out at about 80MBit/second for me, vendor gives me 320MBit/second (over wifi)
        So fine 5 hours later and this is back in its original AP-only config and I'll use a separate router/firewall
        The worst thing about all of this is that important documentation is always hidden in some random obscure forum buried deep in a thread
        Ok why is this device sending a 128 bit value in a field labeled "Public key"
        @mjg59 oh uh it's actually a 512-bit key but they zipped it
        No YOU'RE ordering a next-day delivery IoT device because it's going to be easier to hack than the version you already have
        Too many "Ageism in tech" stories are "YOUNG PEOPLE KEEP REWRITING STUFF UNNECESSARILY" and WHO DO YOU THINK THEY LEARNED THIS FROM
        You had the opportunity to turn software into a rigorous field with solid design patterns but instead you produced over a hundred UNIX forks
        You ignored the lessons of those who came before you, and people are still cleaning up *those* messes as well
        It's true that we have no fucking idea what we're doing, but:
        Everything's shit and you're just as much to blame as we are so how about working on fixing it instead of blaming it all on millenials
        TBF I've got under 4 years until I'm in the same position so I guess I should get on with doing a better job of that
        (It is 2047: there are 3 million thinkpieces complaining about young developers rewriting all the legacy Node.js code in something modern)
        ANYWAY there is legitimate ageism in tech but it's not because they rewrote everything in YET ANOTHER Javascript framework
        (It is 1987: There are 300 thinkpieces complaining about young developers rewriting everything in C)
        Employment figures may be full of lies, but they also help me look good, so, it;s impossible to say if theyre bad or not,
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Russell,_Duchess_of_Bedford ...  is wonderful because it involves court intrigue and the invention of afternoon tea

        @mjg59 Amazon's algorithms are already moving forward the most vulnerable devices into same day delivery range
        The problem in tech is definitely that we have too many Javascript frameworkshttps://twitter.com/mims/status/841262927403450369 ...
