        For example, our mailroom, instead of asking IT for the SMTP server, setup a gmail account for package notifications. I just detected it.

        Tip to novelty account runners:
        I've seen many people inspired to try this, and I'm humbled -- Yakov Smirnoff was more than a schtick. He constructed deeply human connection
        Ex: @sadserver appears to be a joke about a complaining server, but it's actually about you finding a relatable friend in a sterile place.
        DevOpsBorat (RIP) wasn't about stupid people, it was about naÃ¯vete and dead-ends and misunderstanding in a technical-corporate machine.
        Many people have tried "Trump Talks About" accounts, but it's very hard to sustain. Why? Because there is no joy. No absurdity to recognize.
        The core of humor is walking the audience through their own expectations, then a sudden cognitive reward recognizing your subversion of them
        Trump can be parodied in short, strong, topical bursts, but there is no lasting joy to intersperse. No human redemption or relatability.
        Well, that was fun. Let's talk later.

        So I'm kinda convinced people don't understand the difference between Director, VP, CTO, and individual contributor

        A "distinguished engineer" as I refer to it is the highest level... Could be described as having "changed the industry multiple times"

        Honorable people have disagreed about the justice of executing the guilty, but can anyone argue about the justice of executing the innocent?
        An interesting thing we don't know yet: what the next form factor is for computers after phones. Watches? Glasses? Earbuds? Rings?
        We don't even know for sure that there will be a single answer.
        The next Microsoft was a search engine. The next Google was a social network. What will the next Facebook be?
        Asking "what is the next Facebook?" is not the way to find it. You find it by making something you want, probably as a side project.
        One reason there are so few really big startups founded by MBAs is that MBAs don't do side projects.

        "Trump has taken all of the press energy out of the room. There is simply no room for anything else."
        Possibly the biggest cost of Trump: everyone trying to make the world better is now spending some of their attention on him instead.
