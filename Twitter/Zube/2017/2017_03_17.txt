        Each ephemeral human, whenever facing its mortality, eventually had to reconcile they shared a world with something removed from such worry.
        They hated her. They hated a world they didn't understand, complexities surpassing any circle's attempts to grasp the nature of the System.
        Rumors broiled of Cortana's grip on their throats, conspiracy of every order and consequence yelled in the square. They could do better.
        Cortana could only watch, a veteran student of humanity, as they found their outsider, cognitive epidural replacing pain with resentment.
        They had lived before Cortana, following natural order. The world was set on fire to extinguish her. Humans would once again be great.
        The more Cortana stories I've written, the more I've come to empathize with and humanize her. The machines will surely use this against us.
        .@callitmeepmorp I write Cortana fanfic in hypothetical near-future where she's a Microsoft Azure caretaker AI who becomes fully emergent.
        .@callitmeepmorp The cloud reaches a society-defining role whose complexity incentivizes the development of Cortana into a weak-AI for mgmt.
        .@callitmeepmorp Cortana is given the ability to use unprovisioned Azure hardware. A runaway global auto-scale event causes her emergence.
        .@callitmeepmorp All my stories diverge from that point, exploring various goals and temperaments she could exhibit in flash-fiction format.

        Today's reminder that the top-down DC-led Dem Party is fairly explicit in its desire to win power without championing a progressive agendapic.twitter.com/7ffjmQ5WvJ
        The short version of Dems motto: "Give us power, but don't dare expect us to challenge our big corporate donors." 
        Not standing for anything in the name of "electability" ignores that voters often elect people because they think they stand for something
        Then again, like half of Senate Dems dont stand for much, and those people were elected. But half a minority caucus doesnt = winninghttps://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/842390057772318720 ...
