        Great discussion on the business of #ransomware with @seansposito @jeremiahg @ZivMador and @WeldPondhttp://buff.ly/2lvPym3 
        Cyberwar and cyberops are so much more of a thing than most realize. Governments hiring hackers to meet their goals.

        Dreamed I had to comfort a man while he was being embalmed alive. Then I had to carry his pager the rest of the weekend.
        It was in a warehouse, lots of blood, and I didn't even like him but I tried to be a good human in his final moments.
        Then his phone rang and he couldn't answer it because the embalmer had already paralyzed him with a knife. So I looked and it was Pagerduty.
        And when he was dead and the blood had been hosed away his family was like "well you're responsible for his things now" so I went on-call.
        His death was super detailed. I can tell you exactly where the embalmer stabbed him to render his arms useless.
        His cell was an old flip phone so I had to scroll a lot to read the page. ACK with a T9 keyboard.
        I don't remember what he was paged for but I tried to escape after his death and his family chased me down.

        Cloudflare had a bug. A bad one. In the spirit of transparency we've shared all the details.https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug ... 
        So uh, have two .torrent files (in a/ and b/) https://keybase.pub/kyhwana/sha-2/  that are the same, .torrent wise, but are actually different. #infosec
        Yes, your threat model should focus on document macro more than SHA1 collisions. However, SHA1 was already predicted to be broken...
        SHA1 collision with gazillions GPU and hand-crafted binary = hard.
        @veorq Unfortunate coincidence; different teams. It's a big company, these things happen.

        PE would have been trivial, and PDF is more multi-platform (w/ all the readers), and initially seemed impossible, thus more challenging.

        So many people are getting the SHA1 story wrong. With the collision that Google released, *anyone* can create colliding PDFs for *free*.

        Containers should have been replaced with a structure of micro-services, very similar conceptually to Plan 9, SmallTalk, Mach put together.
        At which point each micro service: the TCP/IP stack, the database, the web server, the PHP interpreter, etc. would be isolated and secured.
        You can (and should) break these services down further, just like a micro-kernel. Then you have message-passing between them.
        Another solved problem since, what, the 80s? The problem with microkernels and distributed services was always speed.
        If you tell me that microkernels and distributed isolated services with message passing are slow in 2017 I would like you to explain how... 
        running multiple containers with completely duplicated services can possibly be any faster given a) one NIC, b) one I/O path for data.
        At the very least using message passing you can serialise and optimise requests. But let's not get lost in premature optimisation just yet.
        So, instead of lots of secure small dedicated services, easy to secure because of their small nature, we go for huge stacks of containers... 
        filling up larger and larger servers with duplication.
        So this is why I am sorry the world went "containers" and "VMs". It means, to me, that we took the idiot's path.
        And now, having dumped two of my main lines of thought to the world, I will go off to Wittgenstein.

        INAC, but suspect this to be significantly harder? One of the hashes is fixed (the one for the trusted BIOS), so beyond attacker's control.https://twitter.com/sweis/status/834805573774249985 ... 
        This SHA1 crack is for finding two colliding things.
        @rootkovska Yeah, you'd need to be able to tweak real firmware. But it would give you room to create your own malicious version.
        Extending this reasoning to git, I guess the "security best practices" for vendors should now be: always have your own commit at HEAD?https://twitter.com/rootkovska/status/834868944376852482 ... 
        Otherwise the attacker might give us a benign commit which we happily merge (since benign), but have the colliding one to feed to our users.
        Is git susceptible to the SHA1 collision attacks also by 3rd-parties (in addition to maintainers, which it surely is)? Thread:https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc/status/834876976347373570 ...

        It's amazing how today the _minor_ security news is that SHA1 is broken.
        #OpenPGP requires #SHA1 only for the fingerprint.  To attack this you need to have  pre-image attack and not a collision attack.
        Pre-image attacks are much much harder than collision attack.  We know about collision attacks for a decade and are moving away from #SHA1

        Cloudflare's last published round was NINE FIGURES. I'm sorry they splashed their client's secrets into every cache on the web, but... 
        Cloudflare's problems == Cloudflare's problems.
        Basically in the history of vuln research, nobody who has ever complained about disclosure that followed a published process has been right.
        CF people say this is more complicated than it looks. Totally possible they're right. I'm not involved, just a bystander with opinions.
        I do apologize to @wbm312 for letting that tweet be the vector by which I complain about how crazy this whole thing looks. Not her fault!
        Always easy to forget that "applying patches" isn't the only remedy impacted users have to vuln exposure. People need to know, fast.
        Every day you delay disclosure to make patches smoother, you deprive at-risk users of opportunities to mitigate harm.
        Thunderstorm in February in Chicago. Totally a normal thing. Happens all the time.

        First service alert from the @Cloudflare data leak: @Bugcrowd - well written, out quickly. Curious how many others will be sent out today.
        Here's an email some Cloudflare customers are receiving this morningpic.twitter.com/zfKilCHoy9
        If Cloudflare has a technique for determining which customers have and have not had data exposed, they have not (from what I see) disclosed.
        They can report that THEY THEMSELVES have not found data pertaining to specific customers, but so far as I can tell, that's all they can say
        @tqbf I don't think it's possible, they requested copies of data we removed from cache for analysis but we couldn't do that.
        It is seriously not the craziest idea in the world for them to stand up Cloudflare Challenge #2 with a vulnerable proxy instance.
