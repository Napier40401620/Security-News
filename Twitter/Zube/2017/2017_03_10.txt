        Btw this started because a girl A+ trolled him and he decided to publicly shame her for it.
        He shared a screenshot of him explaining basic finances to her like she was a child

        And he was like "this is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever said on International Women's Day"

        You are going to be phished long before you are going to be hit with CIA 0days. Enable 2FA and get a password manager.
        CIA's hacking tools do not prove they've hacked everyone any more than the fire dept having axes proves they've broken everyone's door down.
        But I suppose if you want idiotic, illogical ways to connect dots to support literally any random conspiracy theory, this is as good as any.
        CIA's job includes spying on targets who might have various electronics. This is exactly the sort of toolkit you'd expect them to have.
        It's not some sort of deep secret that that's the CIA's job. I think it may be on their web page
        Is the CIA misusing these tools? I don't know, maybe they are. The existence of the tools doesn't tell us.
        Just pointing out that I'm a huge dumbass isn't specific enough to be helpful. Please describe what kind of huge dumbass. Thanks.
        If you send me a sequence of >12 tweets annotated with numerous links and I don't respond, it's probably because I think you're a lunatic.
        .@v3rtig0 Sure, but links are always helpful. Also make every other word a hashtag.
        "Any capability the CIA has is being misused, because they always do that" == "The CIA only does good things, because they're good".
        Both are lazy, feel-good substitutes for the hard work of critical, skeptical engagement with facts and evidence.
        Journal just sent me reprints of my just-published paper, which feels so quaint and old-school.
        If you're interested in vulnerability exploit policy, this is a must-read. Most extensive published data I've yet seen.https://twitter.com/RANDCorporation/status/839899849801682945 ... 
        Interesting stat: they found ~6% of stockpiled vulnerabilities were independently rediscovered within a year. Q is what that tells us.
        Note that 6% seems small, but it's basically a lower bound - no way to know about vuls found and kept secret by others.
        But it at least gives us some quantification of the risk of not reporting. Policy Q is how long not reporting is acceptable risk.
        My sense is that this space is highly non-uniform, so over-interpreting the 6%/yr number is probably unwise. Need to find more factors.
        But this is a very important hook for more research on both the technical and policy sides.
        Oh, SSRN, thanks for deciding I'm a bot and need to log in to download someone's paper.

        Most obvious example being that you can't easily fly to much of America anymore. Airline dereg plus mergers.https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/839843552658083840 ... 
        Most think that airline consolidation is bad b/c of baggage fees and consumer problems. That's minor. It kills entire cities and regions.
        It was actually more a function of deregulation and secret villain Stephen Breyer. But consolidation makes it much worse.
        We'll know scholars are serious about regional inequality when they propose re-regulating airlines, trains, and trucking systems.

        Hey @sama you've built a website that celebrates IWD by flagging stories about women overcoming adversity: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13821563 ... 
        FCOP author can't cite any real-world case where FCOP's anti-shaming provisions would have protected someone except Donglegate:https://twitter.com/jdegoes/status/839599517049708544 ... 
        But admits that the "shaming" in Donglegate wouldn't have been an FCOP violation:https://twitter.com/jdegoes/status/839315405260931072 ... 
        ie, there's zero documented cases where the anti-shaming provisions would have achieved the stated goal. It restricts people for no benefit.
        The only people who benefit are abusers. It's bad. Don't use it. Don't go to conferences that do.
        Most straightforward persistent attacks involving grub are blocked by UEFI Secure Boot: https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_13763790.html#efmAu1AvZ ... 
        So can we finally put the idea that Secure Boot provided no security benefits to bed? It wiped out an entire class of attack.
        https://github.com/mjg59/tpmtotp  will protect you against the CIA replacing your bootloader even if they've beaten Microsoft into signing it
        Remember that most attackers who replace bootloaders are not the CIA and are unable to beat Microsoft, so Secure Boot is usually sufficient

        I wrote a book called "Insane Clown President." I'm fine with laughing at Trump. But if this story fizzles, he'll be the one laughing.https://twitter.com/mikeserpe/status/839572155620798466 ... 
        Wait, is that a positive? https://twitter.com/roberams/status/839575105336307712 ... 
        Clapper at least put his name on that statement. And the NYT sources for many of those stories said the same thing.https://twitter.com/theoceanlawyers/status/839577270943690752 ...

        That's why they use it. To stoke the imagination. Same with "yet." Imagine it it just read, "No evidence has been found."https://twitter.com/bluejoni/status/839641238697574400 ...

        All Americans should read this about the actual human beings murdered by Trump's SEAL raid in Yemen https://interc.pt/2mK3RF2  by @ionacraig
        Every incentive in journalism pushes reporters NOT to do this kind of story. Ty to @ionacraig for doing it anywayhttps://interc.pt/2mK3RF2

        .@ionacraig went to Ghayil, the site of Trump's nightmare #Yemen raid. Absolutely incredible story.https://theintercept.com/2017/03/09/women-and-children-in-yemeni-village-recall-horror-of-trumps-highly-successful-seal-raid/ ... 
        Trump said the raid in Yemen was a huge success. But eyewitness accounts contradict the official version of events. https://interc.pt/2mK3RF2 pic.twitter.com/4B8bqOgA2B

        One reason many DC reporters are dazzled by Paul Ryan & don't realize he's a conman is they literally can't do 9th grade math
        Actually this is an unfair exaggeration on my part, to understand this you only need maybe 6th grade mathhttps://twitter.com/tinyrevolution/status/839890564548030464 ...

        Sam Altman, quoted in the NYT, today, calling Trump the "Silicon Valley candidate".https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/how-trump-became-the-first-silicon-valley-president.html?_r=0 ... 
        "He did everything we tell our startups to do". Apparently YC office hours talk a lot more about deporting brown people than I thought.
        Why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Would the CEO of Y Combinator give that fucking quote? WHY? WHAT WAS THE WIN?
        Crawl the fuck out of your own goddamn belly button for a second.
        There is a whole lot I admire and like about YC, but shit like this makes it essentially impossible to defend them.
        THIS RIGHT HEREhttps://twitter.com/Walshman23/status/839609198572875777 ... 
        Well, about 950 of the wars we start are going to fail, but the 10-12 we win will pay for all the losers. Portfolio theory!
        "move fast and break things" I dunno seems like bad advice for the countryhttps://twitter.com/tqbf/status/839608371686801410 ... 
        Also: here right now to dispute that Trump "tested his product early" or "iterated rapidly".
        Challenge: read this whole article and come back to me with ANYTHING AT ALL YC had to gain, for themselves or public policy, by sourcing it.
        In light of the WL leaks this week I'll be releasing some of my latest conference slides for _actual_ state-of-the-art Windows exploitation.
