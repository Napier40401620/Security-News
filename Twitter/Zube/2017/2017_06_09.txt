        Comey says he had a friend who is a professor at Columbia law school to talk to a reporter and tell the reporter about contents of his memo
        Whoah, #Comey arranged the leak of the contents of his memos to #media to help push for independent counsel! In response to tweets re: tapes
        Dear FBI, RELEASE THE MEMO!https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/872836816629575681 ... 

        Comey orchestrating leak probably explains why I got this response from FBI so quicklyhttps://twitter.com/JasonLeopold/status/872687969773211648 ... 

        So FBI should not delay on releasing the unclassified memo he wrote now that Comey has disclosed he orchestrated leakhttps://twitter.com/JasonLeopold/status/872687969773211648 ... 

        The friend is Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Columbia Law School. #ComeyTestimonyhttp://wapo.st/2rDkDHv 
        Clearly, Comey wrote an unclassified memo for a reason
        Comey says he turned over memos to Mueller but Richhman, Columbia law school professor, maybe I'll have a copy of unclassified one
        Everyone call Daniel Richman
        Comey: Many many stories based on classified info abt Russia investigation that are just dead wrong. (I can think of several insane stories)
        Comey: HRC campaign was talking about the investigation into HRC emails as a "matter" and concerned Lynch forcring that characterization too
        Comey Glomaring Cotton
        Re: Clinton email server criminal investigation, Comey says AG Lynch gave him "queasy feeling" when he asked to confirm the investigation 1/
        Comey says he believes he was fired for failing to change the way the Russian investigation was being conducted #Comeytestimony
        Anybody know what McCain is talking about?
        I suppose paying a personal visit to FBI while in town to check on my #FOIA won't help
        OMGhttps://twitter.com/SimonMarksFSN/status/872858486895513600 ... 

        I think what will really piss Trump off about the #ComeyTestimony is when he finds out what the TV ratings are.

        "He said he had nothing to do with Russia, wasn't involved with hookers in Russia." I wiped the hot tears with my necktie. I believed him.
        Trump signaled to Priebus to leave us alone in the room. He gestured at the grandfather clock, which said "Ð”Ð° ÐºÐ°ÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð¾ Ñ…ÑƒÑ Ñ‚Ñ‹ Ð·Ð´ÐµÑÑŒ Ð´ÐµÐ»Ð°ÐµÑˆÑŒ?"
        The thing I want them to ask Comey most: what the hell is up with the eyeliner?

        #MachineLearning within #InfoSec - marketing hype or generating actual value?
        Or are tools just doing counting and looking for anomalies from averages? (which I've seen and reject as "machine learning")
        Realized there's an odd density of security awesomeness in the UK @AlecMuffett @psiinon @mr_goodwin @Scott_Helme something in the water?

        So, say you have a machine with "remote management" of some flavour enabled. 
        Well, it so happens that this is chosen via a BIOS setting, i.e. "in software". Then one discovers that *cough* not all NICs are resilient... 
        to attacks against their firmware nor is BIOS resilient against software modifications. You now have the possibility of flipping your... 
        preferred OOB malware management between extra and intra net, plus free traffic sniffing straight off the NIC. Note that none of this is... 
        purely theoretical: all the bits are on the shelves. They have not been used because, well, "phishing works", mainly.

        Anything interesting on TV this morning?
        I'm glad Senator Burr said there won't be politics at this hearing. I was worried about that.
        I think you'll all agree that the President has been completely vindicated by Failed Dir Comey's opening statement. No reason to watch more.
        "I hope nothing happens to your daughter. It would be a shame".
        Obama's campaign slogan was HOPE. Case closed.
        "That's a nice job you have there. I hope nothing happens to it."
        "Captain Courageous"
        I've got this image in my head of Trump tossing the pillows on the oval office couch desperately trying to find his phone for the last hour.
        Columbia :aw faculty directory getting overwhelmed with hits right now.
        If you phrase something as "I hope" it can't be a crime, and if you ask someone "are you a cop" they have to tell you
        OK, I'll claim points for this one!https://twitter.com/SteveBellovin/status/872828722088468482 ... 
        Sharing the collective "wow" at Comey's inability to answer whether Trump colluded w/ Russia in unclassified setting.
        I wish I had subscribed to the premium package that includes classified-CSPAN.
        I'm sad about McCain here.
        I'm old enough to remember McCain as a sharp, dedicated public servant who was willing to reach across party lines.
        Nice shot of @PreetBharara at the end there.
        If you've been close to someone highly functional but suffering from dementia, that was hard to watch.
        Looks like first round spin is focused on rather bizarre theory that Comey somehow "leaked" classified info & that his notes are classified.
        Extra points for Fargo reference. @PreetBhararahttps://twitter.com/PreetBharara/status/872868034653954048 ... 
        Next will there be an investigation into whether Comey has an email server?
