        In Edge 40 MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe processes are no longer spawned by RuntimeBroker.exe, but directly by the service, this breaks debugging.
        i.e. EdgeWinDbg/EdgeBugId attach to the startup processes & debug children. EdgeCP's  are no longer a children, so won't be debugged. :(

        Part of me loves the hurdles Shadow Brokers make us jump through. I2P, bitmessage, http://bit.surf , zcash. My VMs are now messy
        They sold groups of exploits, didn't work. Then sold individually, seemingly no buyers. Subscription likely a farcehttps://twitter.com/Viss/status/869445122508824576 ... 
        If Shadow Brokers were serious, they would have used any of the numerous dark web markets to handle transactions. Good customer guarantee
        "Hey, we're doing an auction"
        Could selling & dumping exploits serve the same apparent goal of Shadow Brokers (pissing off NSA)? Sure

        The #ShadowBrokers are asking ~$20k USD for its monthly dump service https://twitter.com/shadowbrokerss/status/869436313057075200 ...  #EquationGroup #0day
        They ask for Zcash cryptocurrency, but also make allegation Zcash is somewhat linked to the US government...  #ShadowBrokerspic.twitter.com/cp5sYMDBgo
        The price is much more attractive now. $20k for juicy 0days is honestly cheap.
        So folks, what about crowd funding the #ShadowBrokers dump service? How much are you willing to pay individually?
