        I'm here to drink coffee and rate CFPs...  and I'm all out of coffee 
        If you want your CFP to standout amongst the crowd, try focusing more on making things better. Problem statements, and cool bugs are...  [1/2]
        ...  fun, but aren't moving the state of security forwards. Let's make things better for a change! [2/2]

        Did some tests with #WannaCry sample mentioned in blogpost. Confirm it is not proxy aware. Unless I patch it.https://blog.didierstevens.com/2017/05/13/quickpost-wcry-killswitch-check-is-not-proxy-aware/ ... 
        This finding is significant: domain-based "kill switch" in #WannaCrypt #WannaCry #WCry won't work via proxy so must set-up local/direct DNS.https://twitter.com/DidierStevens/status/863471537898369025 ... 
        All the #WannaCry samples I looked at use mutex MsWinZonesCacheCounterMutexA0, and not MsWinZonesCacheCounterMutexA.https://blog.didierstevens.com/2017/05/14/quickpost-wannacrys-mutex-is-mswinzonescachecountermutexa0-digit-zero-at-the-end/ ... 
        My bad - finished analyzing all #Wannacry worm mods we have and they all have the kill switch inside. No version without a kill-switch yet.
        Nicely spotted sir. You're absolutely right on the Mutex name.pic.twitter.com/8pIt2abw7v

        obviously he was referring to the man who lives in my closet and hand-inspects each packet personally
        questions he was not prepared for: what is the top speed, do you have a white paper, is there a number I can call
        Him: we have three tiers, our top one goes up to a gig, which is obviously too much for most people
        he also told me the name of one of my neighbors who already had the service, so he was great at security as well
        it's not so much that he expected a man to live with me, it's that he looked at me and thought "no way does this hot mess survive alone"
        which is fair
        people are saying they've never heard of ISP salesmen, perhaps I'm using the wrong term?

        You need SMBv1 SMB_COM_NT_TRANSACT and SMB_COM_TRANSACTION2_SECONDARY subcommands to trigger it. Then it sends shellcode thru SMBv2
        Looks like both v1+v2 actually.pic.twitter.com/aN5Pgz6fDv
        Apparently it uses SMB2 for heap spray and SMB1 for triggering. So SMB2 helps but is not strictly neccessary for exploitation.

        The way Wannacry is spun in a particular segment of the Twittersphere makes me prone to conspirational thought.
        Bizarrely & amusingly, the word "haram" has entered local youth slang as synonym for "shitty".
        It's a particular mixture of economic decay, 1.5 centuries of working-class immigration, and that particular slang / social interaction ..
        .. veering from direct to hilarious, rude, and hilariously rude. Loan words from yiddish, polish & turkish.
        A place where you learn about the turkish/kurdish conflict from the other kids when you're a 4th grader.
        I somehow love this place, probably because of all its jagged edges. Quality of life & opportunity is better where I live now, but always...
        ... a special spot in my heart for here.

        And by the way, I think we can successfully make Zcash too traceable for criminals like WannaCry, but still completely private & fungible. ... 
        I _don't_ mean weakening security (https://z.cash/support/faq.html#backdoor ... ). I mean that a secure protocol layer is compatible with good law enforcement.
