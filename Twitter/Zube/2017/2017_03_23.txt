        Why is some random stabbing in the UK front page news here? Unrelated question: what could it be that makes people so afraid of terrorism?
        Stories about terrorist attacks in Iraq or Yemen that kill dozens of people run on page B32. This is an indefensible double standard

        How many advertisements have I seen from IBM in my life? Maybe hundreds? I've seen three from Amazon.
        I know some of IBM's nominal products, but I don't know why - the existential question. Does IBM have a purpose? What does IBM _do_?
        These are rhetorical questions on the nature of business narrative in the modern public consciousness, and the fact IBM has nothing.
        Halliburton and KPMG have better public understanding of their business proposition than IBM, whose communications have failed for a decade.
        I'm lonely.
        Note - none of this is about IBM products or non-leadership employees at all. Just exacerbated they blow so much money to advertise nothing.

        @kiniry @tozny JOSE invented unnecessary new ways of doing things that force core crypto libs to expose lower-level, error-prone APIs.
        @kiniry @tozny E.g. It is dumb to define a JSON serialization for ECC public keys when there is a better existing standard for it.
        Unless you're doing original research, it's a BAD IDEA to try to "sum up" the problems with JOSE/JWT. Not everything is public.
        So for instance if you're trying to write a "defense" of JOSE, probably don't base it on @CiPHPerCoder's post. Barely scratches surface.
        Prediction: if JOSE remains popular, there will be YEARS of clever findings in it. It's a cryptanalyst jungle gym. That's the problem!
