        I'm going to be a contestant on http://tv.esquire.com/shows/american-ninja-warrior ...  next month.  I'm gonna represent parent basement dwelling, 400 pound hax0rs.
        After I told my sister I was going on American ninja warrior, she said "do you have the upper body for that?" :(
        I'm sure @0xcharlie is participating in American Ninja Warrior because he does not take bug bounty below $1M anymore. #GoCharlie #haxx0r

        Ah yes, STEM majors are the masters of the humanities. That's why talking to them is such a respectful and balanced experience.
        STEM majors aced all history classes and therefore approach all topics of diversity with the gravitas they require.
        STEM majors ruled communications class, which is why all their slides are readable and engaging.
        STEM majors score top marks in writing, just look at any controversial PR.
        STEM majors are boss in both politics and economics. That's why every startup succeeds.
        I went to a technical institute. I had liberal arts classes with STEM majors. And: no.
        .@yungjollyboy I have a BFA and a STEM job. STEM is easy. No schooling required. Good luck!

        PHP is still a better choice than Perl though, and we still see lots of Perl on assessments...
        We do metrics for our big customers on platform choice versus number of critical findings. It is by far the biggest factor.

        The recent veneration of George W. Bush & Glenn Beck suggests there are no limits on media's power to whitewash history & rehab images

        Just think how much a left-wing Tea Party could have gotten done had it been half as active in 2009 when Dems actually had power.
        With media companies monetizing today's resistance, I wonder: what corporations monetized resistance movements of the 1930s & 1960s?
        America's economy efficiently turns resistance to a real estate mogul at Trump Tower into profits for media moguls just down the street.
