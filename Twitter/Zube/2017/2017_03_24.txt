        Behold an airline trying to cope with the full ridiculousness of the electronics travel ban:https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-introduces-laptop-and-tablet-handling-service-for-us-flights ... 
        "perhaps the silver lining to this is that they can now justifiably give themselves a break from their devices and enjoy the 20 hour flight"
        "Electronics ban does not apply to Emirates' US-bound flights via Milan and Athens," but don't tell the bad guys about that!
        I'm impressed with how rapidly Emirates was able to reframe a huge, pointless inconvenience as a special perk for business travelers
        @Pinboard Emirates should just stop over all their US bound flights in Athens. Would also be nice for the local economy.
        Could airlines skirt the electronics travel ban by just doing a touch-and-go landing at an intermediate European airport?
        Good point about landing with a full fuel load. But adding a refueling stop might actually save airlines money.https://twitter.com/DataG/status/844951592164052992 ...

        Wow.https://twitter.com/EtihadAirways/status/844944603195330560 ... 

        My big secret hope for commercial aviation is that terrorists learn to form explosives into the shape of a crying toddler
        Another flaw in my 'just land and refuel en route' plan is that a lot of plane maintenance is based on number of takeoff/landing cycles
        @Pinboard Sorry, but the "tasty sandwich bomber" is coming first, after which we will all have to purchase airport concessions.

        From the person @donnabrazile thanked for her "good journalism."https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/844907549103140865 ... 
        My point is that @LouiseMensch is crazy and yet is being cited by once-reputable news orgs and reporters all over the place.https://twitter.com/jimboston2014/status/844932467521994752 ... 
        No, but they invalidate her. Which should bother people, unless they don't mind Alex Jones-style politics.https://twitter.com/twitslovetotwit/status/844933726895312896 ... 
        She thinks Putin assassinated Andrew Breitbart, believes Weiner was sexting with a Russian spy, and now says Putin is training ISIS fightershttps://twitter.com/jimboston2014/status/844934280577011714 ... 
        Are we talking about Chechens and Dagestanis? I notice you were careful to use the word "citizens" there.https://twitter.com/on_politike/status/844938523341926401 ... 
        You're seriously going to claim there haven't been Islamic terrorist attacks in Russia?https://twitter.com/on_politike/status/844940013880184834 ... 
        Really? Like the March 1 assertion that Anthony Weiner wasn't sexting with a 15 year-old, but Russian hackers? https://twitter.com/louisemensch/status/836997321024028674 ... https://twitter.com/guffer44/status/844941548815028224 ... 
        Lately like March 1, when she said Weiner sexted with Russian hackers? Or Feb 14, when she said Russian moles activated FBI/Weiner probe?https://twitter.com/wfolive/status/844941173164773378 ... 
        This is solid and well-sourced? https://patribotics.blog/2017/02/14/the-carolina-conspiracy-putin-catfished-weiner-louise-mensch/ ... https://twitter.com/tpkern/status/844945112971051009 ... 
        You believe the FBI field office in New York is teeming with Russian agents?https://twitter.com/tpkern/status/844945112971051009 ... 
        Okay, is "Russia has a team of influencers inside the FBI field office" better?https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/844945786353991682 ... 
        She's been right that Anthony Weiner sexted with Russian hackers and Russian moles in the FBI kick-started the Comey letter?https://twitter.com/mailibradley/status/844967911953481728 ... 
        The 15 year-old and her parents were interviewed by the Daily Mail. Also, premise is absurd: Russians lured Weiner to provoke Comey letter?https://twitter.com/mrfknsunshine/status/844970566616473600 ... 
        You would have to believe they specifically targeted Weiner with the aim of kick-starting an HRC email investigation - in the nick of time!https://twitter.com/mrfknsunshine/status/844970566616473600 ...

        Well, this got ugly fast. I remember when I was a College Republican...which I became because a Campus Dem spit on me when I was in uniform.https://twitter.com/michelle_sham/status/842718268280528897 ... 
        That was a more innocent time, the Reagan years. I got called a baby-killer for just being in ROTC.
        But I quickly discovered that knee-jerk conservatives were just as bad as the Trotskyite Campus Dem who spit on me. Just more polite to me.
        Campus politics is not the real world. People come in with views that have not been distilled by experience.
        However, @michelle_sham, unless you speak about your views and defend them intellectually instead of emotionally, you'll never evolve.
        .@michelle_sham At the same time, realize there are people whose very nature is cause for the kind of abuse you fear--from "conservatives".
        .@michelle_sham those people--LGBT, African American, Muslim, etc.--have not been given the chance to hide their nature to protect themselves.
        .@michelle_sham I didn't fully understand injustices those people face until I was in the real world and saw it firsthand as a Navy officer.
        .@michelle_sham That Campus Dem who spit on me was rich white girl who saw my uniform as the same sort of target R's see LGBT, Muslims as.
        I find people who fear talking about their beliefs around others feel that way because they don't understand why they believe those things.

        I don't understand what the positive outcome is for D filibuster of Gorsuch nomination. How do they win?
        People keep comparing Gorsuch to Garland nomination. But it's not the same: GOP controlled Senate for Garland. D's don't control Senate now.
        If you're McConnell -- demonstrably an able Senate operator -- you know D's will reject 1st nom out of hand. How do you play it?
        Easy: you encourage T to nominate your 2nd choice, hold 1st in reserve. D's filibuster. You let 2nd choice withdraw.
        Now nominate 1st choice: Pryor or Sykes. D's must filibuster. But: precedent for consecutive filibuster? Rule change, 1st choice gets in.
