        The most effective way to defeat secure encryption is to make people stop using it. Rumors of "backdoors" are a powerful weapon
        I work with hundreds of activists; those Guardian hit pieces totally destroyed their confidence in Signal. 
        The root of trust problem in mass-market secure messaging is a big one. How do you as a non-technical user evaluate claims about backdoors?
        Unfortunately, the people you trust most in other contexts are unlikely to have a correct opinion about what technologies are safe
        The reason I harp about the @guardian so much is because it was a catastrophe. Entire security industry speaking in unison, ignored

        2016 50" 4K Samsung for $400 shippedhttps://twitter.com/woot/status/873404389666541568 ... 
        I just bought a refurb TV...actually brand new in box, never opened, factory wrapping. They must have to sell unopened returns as refurb.
        I also just bought a refurb monitor, also completely new factory wrap, but in generic box, they must have screwed up the original packaging
        I could see analog stuff getting refurbed with iffy repairs, but digital panel displays? No way they bother actually repairing economy LCDs?
        I mean, we're in a disposable society now, do electronics companies ACTUALLY refurbish anything? Is it even worth the shipping or labor?
        I'd think the controller boards and ports are more likely to fail than the LED/LCD. I've had 2 TVs go bad that way.
        I have replaced LOTS of cheap & easy controllerboards, thus making an otherwise binned product repaired for under $20 in parts & 1hr of time
        Would depend on cost analysis. Had a friend that worked at Intel before. His job was destroying CPUs when one in a batch failed.
        I own two flat screen tvs i got off the street and repaired myself with 30 cents of parts
        Rest of batch could be fine but more cost effective to dump a whole batch than test all. So I don't know.

        Didnt know I was reacting to an abstract. Just saying the "offense given more focus than defense" doesnt fit my experience. Willing to learn
        I got it, just laughing to myself how even an abstract can kick off disagreement. This is going to be fun!
        the vast majority of industry talks, academic papers and market spending goes to defensive security. Offense prevalence  is overstated

        That said, media reporting on the subject is sparse but generally fairly solid in this country.
        Many German journalists don't understand intel  analysis, thereby attribution. Germany wants to do hackback but lacks the capability.

        Weird to call what Comey & Richman did "leaking", given it was done with Comey's consent. That's just being a news source, not leaking.
        And this mischaracterization is coming on two fronts - both defenders of leaks and people trying to make Comey seem shady.
        While it's important to defend leaks that inform the public, calling what Comey did "leaking" distorts the term beyond recognition.
        We've always been at war with Qatar.
        I think Comey was wrong about crypto backdoors. That doesn't make it OK to smear him.
        Does anyone know how to erase digital audio? Only need about 18 minutes worth.
        For news and twitter discussion of cancer fund siphoning and Reality WInner, etc, we'll have to wait for the directors cut version of 2017.
        The chances that any Trump/Comey recordings were literally on magnetic tape are slim. Next up: a close parsing of the meaning of "tape".
        My secret hope is that Trump turns over a box of wax cylinders, or maybe wire recordings.
        In retrospect, it's now clear why, all through his dinner with the FBI director, Trump kept saying "hey Siri".
        Romanian President Iohannis better hope there were no "tapes" of their discussion.https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/873271359480246272 ... 
        Worth remembering that even if Comey really is the scoundrel that Trump says he is, that doesn't make the Russian investigation go away.
        Comey's character as relevant to the existence of Russian interference as Al Gore's character is relevant to the existence of climate change
        Or, for that matter, as relevant as my character is to whether voting machines can be hacked.
        There are some pretty bad jobs in the world. Who could have imagined "Personal Lawyer to the President of the US" would become one of them.
        Sounds like the Trump Havana International Resort and Casino deal must have gone sour.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/873357060414595072 ... 
        I really didn't expect us to get into a two front war with Romania and Qatar.
        No, this is ABSOLUTELY NOT a coded message for our Russian handlers.

        The DUP was born out of a movement to favour protestants, deny civil rights to catholics and resist any real attempt at peace in NI
        While their links to terrorist groups were never as overt as Sinn Fein's, they happily collaborated with them (eg, in the 1974 strike)
        They've moved away from that level of rhetoric and protestant supremacy, but their leadership has a strong lineage to that era
        Their social positions (anti-abortion, anti-marriage equality, and so on) are awful, but their founding principles are even worse
        It's not merely legitimate to ask why May will ally with a party that barely recognised the humanity of catholics, it's imperative

        Weird to call what Comey & Richman did "leaking", given it was done with Comey's consent. That's just being a news source, not leaking.
        And this mischaracterization is coming on two fronts - both defenders of leaks and people trying to make Comey seem shady.
