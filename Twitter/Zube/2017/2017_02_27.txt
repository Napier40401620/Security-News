        As the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner is an elitist Beltway circle jerk, you'd think that Trump would happily attend.

        To liberals who keep wailing about THE RUSSIANS!, please cram your Cold War Loyalty Oath agitprop up Harry Truman's dead ass. Thanks!

        Thanks to 58 intrepid people who came out on a toasty Saturday in February to the Boston meeting! Next meetup is 7 PM Tuesday in Los Angeles
        Lost it at the thought of how many 'batman hats with cape and brim' go to actual orphans. Syrian kids need toys too: https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/27U39581F9IPQ ... 
        Amazon wish list for NuDay Syria, who presented at TS Boston today. Items get container shipped to Syrian families: https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/27U39581F9IPQ ... 
        NuDay Syria explained at our event today that what matters to recipients is not just donated stuff, but that people cared enough to send it
        My unwelcome but correct opinion: stop donating to ACLU national, direct the money to smaller and more local orgs (including ACLU-state!)
        At this point ACLU national is flush, and can only buy mink cupholders for its new Rolls Royce fleet. Lots of better places to give
        Here's an Amazon wish list of tech stuff for NuDay Syria based on today's presentation in Boston.(thanks @kategeek!) https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/giftlist/SUR511LL0IDY ... 
        @pinboard in this spirit, @ProgressGive tweets out suggestions four times daily for people who want to go beyond Planned Parenthood and ACLU

        Ignore all the boasting from Amazon and Google. We invented the 'always-on home microphone' in Eastern Europe back in the fifties
        "Police seized Bates' phone, and had he installed the Alexa app, could have been able to obtain the voice records."http://venturebeat.com/2017/02/23/amazon-claims-first-amendment-protection-in-alexa-murder-case/ ... 
        I know this will sound controversial, but...  disable the always-on microphone services in your life, especially the ones on your phone.

        .@KathViner are you worried that your ombudsman's been gone for over a month? Are we sure his "vacation" is voluntary? Asking for 70 friends
        .@KathViner since the Guardian ombudsman is the only way to get harmful false stories retracted, consider getting him a satellite phone?
        .@KathViner or maybe (brainstorming now) have *two* people with the authority to save your paper's reputation, who don't holiday together

        I also like their French Breakfast. I don't have any of either right now, because I'm trying to explore other brands/flavors.
        This teapot pours nicely, which is a shame because it's kinda ugly. Also these shortbread cookies are so good. My skin is turning to butter.

        Mama,
        At some point, the SHAdy PDFs were working under every reader, except Safari. It turned out its JPEG parsing was more picky than others.
        In earlier version, the 'double-JPG' didn't work under Safari in an unexpected way: one JPG was displayed *transparently* on the other!
        At some point, I created a very crazy JPG (even patching libjpeg). this particular JPG displayed random glitches in Adobe Reader. oops ;)
        I repurposed some old visualisation code for the SHA-1 collision to show the actual bit patterns involved: https://vegard.github.io/sha1/ 
        If you collide PDFs, you can look for exotic 0day fragments as they disintegrate. NSA is building a PDF collider in Utah.https://twitter.com/steike/status/834826657768865793 ...

        Message to AJC propagandists: dissent always feels "divisive" if you're the establishmenthttps://twitter.com/NomikiKonst/status/835315412917178368 ... 
        Most bullshit criticism of dissent--"You're being divisive." Hey establishment, just agree with the dissenters and the divisiveness will end!
        Fascinating watching the Democratic Party continue its slow-motion suicide.
        Keith Ellison was defeated by a billionaire-led innuendo campaign slurring him as an anti-semite. That's the Democratic Party for you.
        The very people who are responsible for historic, sustained failure have been rewarded instead of penalized. Classic mark of decadence.
        What do you call it when you do the same thing over and over again and expect different results? Oh yeah: the Democratic Party. #DNCChair
        Still think the problem is Putin, Bernie, Stein, Sarandon, media, FBI, etc? Or maybe the self-perpetuating, senile Dem party establishment?

        American democracy is so dominated by corporate power that the country's major left-of-center party had a lobbyist nominate its chairman
        Bill Paxton was a great actor -- and "Weird Science" was among his best performances. RIP Chet.pic.twitter.com/AtO9CGwCvO
        A reminder that the "corporate lobbyists are mostly good Democrats" guy gave Tom Perez the votes to go over the tophttp://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/5/14176068/dnc-chair-lobbyists ...

        What do you call it when you do the same thing over and over again and expect different results? Oh yeah: the Democratic Party. #DNCChair
        Dems clearly proved their love of the grassroots by having DC folk install a chairman & voting to take lobbyist cash https://www.google.com/amp/s/static.theintercept.com/amp/tom-perez-dnc.html ... https://twitter.com/isaacdovere/status/835843840758136832 ...

        @davidsirota Ah, the post Ellison-loss whining. Trump thanks you for your hard work.

        Many #UniteBlue folk who claim to be most focused on stopping Trump backed a candidate who polled worse against Trump than the other choice
        This suggests for these folks, it's never really been about stopping Trump. It's about establishment ideology/powerhttps://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/835893345490620417 ... 
        Proposal: You dont get to now pretend u care most about stopping Trump if u backed the Dem primary candidate who polled worse against Trump
        Which is a more accurate hashtag for Dems?
        This is the "hey grassroots: sit down, shut up & give us your cash" post-election phase of DNC race -- a replica of 2016's post-primary phase
        "I helped lose to Trump & all I got was this stupid T-shirt (and to keep my Dem Party job/consulting gig)" - might be a good t-shirt
        90% of media is owned by 6 companies. Now media CEOs are eagerly telling investors Trump will help them own more.http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/who-controls-media-cbs-sinclair-ceos-predict-consolidation-if-donald-trump-goes ... 
        Trump opponents should rest easier knowing the only party able to stop Trump just preserved the power of those who oversaw the loss to Trump

        9. Until someone in the Democratic Party is willing to be honest about what happened, it will worsen. And no, progressives aren't there yet.
        10. Also, this was a very winnable race for Keith Ellison. Yes it was full of insiders, but they were open to him and Perez was not strong.
        @matthewstoller @aptaube ellison ran as a uniter. he should have been tearing into the clinton/obama camps' failures
        News from @keithellison @TomPerez joint gaggle: Ellison will NOT leave House, plans to try to build better connex tween hill and dnc.
        This embarrassment should have been canceled years ago. It's just a celebration of corruption.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/835608648625836032 ... 
        Even if I did want to support progressive Dems, they never wanna scrap anyway. Ellison told us to stay out of it!https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/835608496607490048 ... 
        Thrilled to see @TomPerez elected chair of the @DNC. A great man, a great leader, and a clarion voice for progressive change. #DNC #unity

        I think it's likely that in 2018 there's a Democratic wave. The question is what does that Dem majority believe?http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/delaware-special-senate-election_us_58b22659e4b060480e089560?3uk9zh353rq7zxgvi ... 
        In 2006, Rahm Emanuel and Howard Dean did a great job existing while Bush ran an unpopular war. And they elected shitty Dems everywhere.
        In 2008, it was a similar dynamic. Party institutions mostly shape not whether a party wins, but what parties do in power.

        Banks foreclosed on active duty soldiers, some committed suicide, but Perez never pressed criminal charges #DNCChairhttps://theintercept.com/2017/02/22/dnc-chair-candidate-tom-perezs-bank-friendly-record-could-kneecap-the-democratic-party/ ... 
        Ellison's loss is part of a global wave of center-left types being unable to put forward a coherent vision in the face of tyranny.
        There's a big ideological difference b/n Perez and Ellison. But Ellison didn't run on it.https://theintercept.com/2017/02/22/dnc-chair-candidate-tom-perezs-bank-friendly-record-could-kneecap-the-democratic-party/ ... 
        Irony is that Ellison claim that only he could unify the left was weakened by Trump -- who really was unifying themhttps://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/835835632471715840 ... 
        That's not totally true. Lots of DNC members are frustrated, they just didn't see a reason to pick Ellison.https://twitter.com/TheLateHarambe/status/835862862010601473 ...
