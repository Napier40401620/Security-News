        I heard of a photographer who couldn't sell his pictures of the World Trade Center because it was copyrighted. This does not sound kosher!
        They use trademark law, not copyright, to restrict photography. See also http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/local_news/pebble-beach-co-tells-artists-they-can-t-sell-their/article_866e02fd-b117-5fe3-a69d-4be25f10a861.html ... 
        They try to use trademark rights. But their letters can be general enough to give other impressions.https://jonathanturley.org/2014/08/04/new-york-port-authority-claims-ownership-of-skyline-image-in-latest-trademark-abuse/ ... 
        I'm not sure that it is a trademark prevents other from selling photos of it, if that's all they are doing.
        Have to make a commercial use and cause confusion as to source, AND not be making a fair nominative fair use.
        I'm certain they'd get threatened and sued, but that's different than saying they can't sell photos b/c of TM.

        Surprisingly, it appears IT did not invent complex human systems failure.
        [CORRECTION] Thank you @JohnBrownlow, it appears the two datacenters were on separate customer power systems, it was grid/area that was same
        However, this physical proximity was not involved in the cause of this failure. It is a legitimate, but separate concern from this incident.
        I wrote the tweet emphasizing shared power system, hours after I first read the article. My fault for not verifying my memory. I apologize.

hashbreaker

        We built two shiny new servers for web service. Changed DNS records. A day later http://ahrefs.com  is still pestering the old servers.
        Interesting new public-key cryptosystem in https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/481 . Obviously can use any sparse prime 2^b-2^c-..., not just Mersenne prime.
        Encrypting only a single bit is annoying. Users really want to recover A,B from AF+BG mod p for sparse A,B,F,G. Backtracking? Coppersmith?
        Try to choose B deterministically to compress AH+B, as in Streamlined NTRU Prime? Is it safe to, e.g., force each byte of AH+B to be odd?
        Assuming A,B can be quickly recovered from AF+BG, build a standard KEM by hashing (A,B) etc. Particularly clean (Dent) for deterministic B.
        Can also try to imitate other code-based/lattice-based constructions, e.g. LPR. An error-correcting code for M allows correcting M+AF-BG.
        Can also try to prove that F/G mod p is indistinguishable from uniform, as in Stehle--Steinfeld, assuming that F and G have enough bits set.
        Needless to say, nobody should be relying on any of this for security unless and until parameters survive years of thorough cryptanalysis.
