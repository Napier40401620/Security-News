        What I like about automatic transmissions is that they're something I know I can't even begin to fake being an expert at. Incredible stuff.
        They're an amazing example. Everyone's used one, most own one, but not a single "user" can actually claim to fathom how they really function
        You could drive a car for 2000 years and intuitively gain legitimately no greater knowledge of how an automatic transmission works.

        what a blessing twitter is
        Ok @s0ulshake has the most fun way to read her CV I've ever seen.
        it's been 45 min and nothing has changed but also nothing is broken

        "Look at this heartwarming ad where we put a trans woman in a potentially dangerous situation awwww have a beer"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wYXw4K0A3g ... 
        "You know what? Misogynists deserve love too."
        "Science is the perfect place for a Both Sides discussion."
        Seriously you outed a trans woman to someone who is publicly transphobic what the fuck is wrong with you
        He could have attacked her
        You can see her tense up when the reveal is made. She's scared.
        She goes along with it because that's a learned survival tactic but don't for one second think this is a great thing that happened
        You want to think they all stay out of the goodness of their hearts but it's more likely to save face or to fulfill a paid contract.
        Fuck Heinekin for cashing in on trans hate
        Even if the people are actors, the ad is still saying "hey it's ok to out a trans person because transphobics just need friends!"
        when in reality transphobics build a society that kills trans people

        Hacker Fantastic is right, it has been demonstrated that they don't care about ethics & market to stalkers  https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-flexispy-the-company-getting-rich-selling-stalkerware-to-jealous-lovers ...  #wronghttps://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/857248305788616704 ...

        I agree with @hackerfantastic @botherder bcuz making the world a better place is not only about securing things but also setting example (1)

        to be clear, if a stalkerware co approached @bugcrowd for a program we'd politely tell them to #diaf. ethics do actually matter.
        A shady grey market company with offshore accounts that sells malware facilitating crime through obscene loopholes shouldn't be worked with.
        This isn't selling baby monitoring or for child safety, this is a company selling tools without ethics and promoting for domestic spying.
        Lets talk about bug bounties. My experience. And why I'm going to push my company to start one. It's not about money or mercenaries.

        But hey just so everyone knows, if such a project is started then every contributor in it is actually me and I deserve all the recognition

        The unfortunate moment when you discover half your anonymous contributors keep pasting nazi propaganda into commit messages
        I've seen the future, and unfortunately it's go apps calling into rust libraries via cgo
        People's motivations towards free software are shaped by the experiences they've had in life. Their stories shape their code.
        When you argue that a community is strengthened by anonymity, you give people a choice - hide those stories or risk leaking their identity.
        If your stories are common then there's much less risk. You can talk about why a use case is important without giving much away.
        But if your experiences are niche, that's untrue. Talking about how a feature would impact people like you reduces your anonymity.
        If anonymity brings benefits, and working on use cases you care about brings benefits, the people who benefit most are the existing majority
        Everybody else has to sacrifice one or the other and is less likely to be attracted as a result. You cement the majority as the norm.
        This is just one of the reasons why anonymous development communities are a bad idea. There are many, many others.
        (And, strangely, they almost all disproportionately harm everyone except the existing majority!)

        The heckler's veto of Coulter's Berkeley speech is a loss for the 1st Amendment. We must protect speech on campus, even when hateful.

        Things tech people can organize around: 
        2. Equity transparency (shares outstanding, investment terms, liquidation prefs, real runway, sales numbers/revenue plan).
        3. Engineering management and hiring/performance tracking, currently done ad-hoc and by fiat; top reason for employee turnover.
        4. Growth vs. reliable engineering and security. Lots of engineers feel unrealistic growth demands put users at risk, leave devs culpable.
        5. Working conditions, guaranteed/recoupable vacation, on-call expectations, work-from-home, open office.
        6. Social impact of work. Lots of good people doing work in e.g. adtech with little say in future abuse of data they collect.
        7. Exclusivity and credentialism, the trend in our industry away from merit and towards e.g. male CMU graduates. Also: ageism! Huge!
        8. The nonexistent career ladder most companies have for hard-tech people; expectation of "up into management or out".
        Long story short: I do not accept the argument that tech is so well paid it can't organize. Tech is so well paid IT SHOULD ORGANIZE.
