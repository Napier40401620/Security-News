        If only Bush flipped a coin to see if he would be charged with war crimes. #SuperBowl
        "There's not a tougher man in this stadium tonight." Joe Buck on elder Bush. I'm sure that Panamanians and Iraqis would agree. #SuperBowl
        Corporate media celebrates diversity. You can thank social movements for that. #SuperBowl
        Corporate media follows where the culture goes in order to sell to it. That's why Trump's racist vision will never take deep root.#SuperBowl
        I trust that Trump's supporters are enjoying all the non-white people in these ads. #SuperBowl
        Never forget Terry Bradshaw's pivotal performance in the Burt Reynolds classic HOOPER. #SuperBowl
        Sean Spicer just tweeted his happiness that the Patriots are winning 35-0. #SuperBowl
        Tom Brady looks deflated. #SuperBowl
        Trump vows to make Mexico pay for that 84 Lumber ad. #SuperBowl
        #SuperBowl halftime shows remind me how ahead of his time Liberace was. Rip Taylor, too.
        As a tweeter, in all seriousness, I enjoy the backup dancers. This is a big gig for them, and you can see it on their faces. #SuperBowl
        Forget praying for Trump. Katie Nolan is "still recovering" from Lady Gaga. #SuperBowl
        Good thing Melissa McCarthy has nine lives. #SuperBowl
        Mike Pence enjoying the game with a tall glass of spinal fluid. #SuperBowl
        Spuds MacKenzie's ghost is haunting the Falcons. #SuperBowl
        I also thought that Trump would lose the election. #SuperBowl
        The Falcons should have campaigned in Wisconsin. #SuperBowl
        Trump's reign of terror continues. #SuperBowl

        Open source enthusiasts, what's your favourite mailing list archiving tool that looks decent? Preferably extendable to include own layout?
        There's HyperKitty (bonus points for the name!) which looks decent, but seems to be pretty heavy: https://hyperkitty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 
        There's HyperMail which is ancient and doesn't seem very extensible:https://github.com/hypermail-project/hypermail ... 
        There's also Mhonarc, which I'm now using, but man those config files are a horror to work with: https://www.mhonarc.org/

        HOLY SHIT DID I JUST SEE A SCIENTOLOGY COMMERCIAL #SuperBowl
        Would not have expected that ad from 84 Lumber.
        97 tech companies file amicus against travel ban. Uber. Lyft. PayPal. Google. YC. Apple. Facebook. Intel. LinkedIn. Netlix.
        It's not that any ads are attacking Trump. It's that Trump is so outside all norms of decency that basic, bland sentiments feel anti-Trump.

        There is nothing about JWT that I like. JWT is astonishingly bad. Avoid JWT.
        "[Encrypted] JWTs are sometimes nested: an encrypted JWT serves as the container for a signed JWT. This way you get the benefits of both."
        There is nothing about this story that isn't perfect.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/africa/zimbabwe-frog-cave-squeaker.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fscience&action=click&contentCollection=science&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=sectionfront&_r=0&mtrref=news.ycombinator.com&gwh=C6C50FAB75C7E1D98FE41ED8E4186E19&gwt=pay ... 
        Teachers union connection to Collins and Murkowski defection seems overblown. Donations a rounding error compared to top donors.
        I'm actually disappointed by this: was hoping to find 3 more senators (Thune and Hoeven, btw) with outsized teacher union donations.
        In CS, we have in-band signaling, and we have out-of-band signaling. Security people prefer out-of-band.
        Please don't blow this off, esp. if you have 2 D Senators. It is not at all guaranteed that your D Senators will vote down DeVos.https://twitter.com/Upstreamism/status/828458916476547074 ...

        RSA is a terrible conference -- just abominable -- so if you're looking for a reason not to go: https://nofly90.com/ 
        What makes this perfect is that the suits will think you're actually sacrificing something, because they think RSA is really important.
        In conclusion: I am not sure why any of you travel to RSA. I've never understood it. That is all.

        JWT has a "header" and a "payload" field and I think literally the sole purpose of "header" is to allow it to be stripped by attackers.
