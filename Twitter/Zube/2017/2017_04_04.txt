        One interesting thing about car security is even if they start securing cars now, average age of car on road: 11 yrshttps://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/07/29/new-car-sales-soaring-but-cars-getting-older-too/30821191/ ... 
        But no car makers are talking about back porting security technologies to older cars.  This shows why important to start fixing stuff now!
        Like when we found the exploit against 2014 jeeps, it didn't matter that it didn't work against 2015 jeeps.  It's still a big deal.
        For the record we found the bug in 2014 and when we bought the jeep, 2015 model wasn't out yet.
        But the point is if today I found a bug that let you crash a bunch of 2012 cars, it wouldn't matter how secure the 2017 models were.

        Comedians and jazz musicians are more comforting to me than preachers or politicians or philosophers or poets or painters or novelists.
        Somebody gets into trouble, then gets out of it again. People love that story. They never get tired of it.
        Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh,  there is less cleaning up to do afterward.

        My brother pointed me to an important medical paper that is frequently cited about the risks of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. (1/n)
        The data set is fascinating. 18.8% of the sample that did not consume alcohol during pregnancy consumed cocaine, 45% of the sample that ...
        .. did consume moderate quantities of alcohol consumed cocaine, and 69.7% of those that consumed a lot of alcohol consumed cocaine. Some ..
        .. questions: Where on earth does one find a sample of pregnant women like that, and how on earth does one not investigate whether the ...
        .. lighter birth weights etc. associated with alcohol consumption isn't actually caused by the cocaine???
        Emily Oster did great work breaking down and contextualizing this exact set of research in her book Expecting Better.
        Okay. Mastodon is pretty rad.

        The best thing about imperial measurements is that the UK and the US disagree on their definitions

        Welp.
        One reason federated protocols worry me is that historically they have not been good at preventing abuse
        How do you kick a user off a federated system? Does this just end up being like rbl was for smtp?
        Most common response is reputation. That's basically what happened in email, and people are unhappy that only gmail has good reputation.
        (Or, at least, are unhappy that gmail doesn't trust random independently run servers)
        (PS I work for Google but not on gmail and have zero idea what gmail does other than the publicly described things)
        Questioning whether you should be able to kick someone off a service is missing the point. Many people want abusive users to be kicked off.
        That means services that make this possible are more attractive, and federated systems need an answer to that argument.
