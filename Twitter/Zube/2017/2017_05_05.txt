        Thanks everyone. You really mean a lot to me, especially at times like this.
        Humans are exceptional, we have to be cared for during birth, but even then our mothers risk everything. Bodies. Their lives. To make ours.
        This isn't charity. It's not an entitlement. A village must raise every child, because they know, the mother may not be there to do it.
        I just did this. It's scary, but at these hours it's just a voicemail, and they do listen to them! It's the perfect time to say something!https://twitter.com/sturmen/status/859967863133810689 ... 
        Been doing this since April 2014 and this is the first time I've ever actively advocated calling your representatives. This is not a drill.
        Thank you to everyone who's gone with me over the years, who knows I've suffered trying to give the benefit of the doubt. But this is wrong.
        Have a good night, may whatever deity  watches over us have some measure of compassion for the weakest and most vulnerable. God help us.
        Btw, don't ever let the shame of having clicked a phishing link stop you from reporting it. IT needs to know so they can remediate the issue
        Oh absolutely yes this. I promise you, I'm a seasoned IR expert and I've been fooled. Recently.
        You have no idea how many times a user has lied to me about this. I don't want to punish you. I want to remediate!!

        My bag went missing in a Chicago bar in January. Just got email from their IT guy who booted laptop to find my identity. So many questions
        For starters, the bag contained two passports. You don't need full IT forensics to figure out whose bag it was. Second, a bar has an IT guy?
        Third, how do you wait 4 months to figure out who a bag in your lost and found belongs to, when it has two passports and a $2k laptop?
        Fourth, why not connect the dots between the bag in your lost and found, and the guy frantically calling/visiting your bar 3 days in a row?

        Technocratic neoliberalism assumes its real polity is start-ups; citizens are just generic, intermediary stuff of which start-ups are made.
        The future of (non-) politics is social democratic algorithms demanding a more humane, reformist version of themselves.
        Behind every discussion on the ethics of algorithms is a suppressed discussion about the unjustifiable profits of their makers.

        School in Minnesota keeps sending me email intended for parents of random 7th grader. Refuses to fix email address "because of privacy laws"
        I just spent the last two hrs on the phone and sending email back and forth with the school district, and it gets dumber with each exchange.
        At one point I think they thought I WAS the 7th grader trying to soc engineer them into changing parent's email. At least that's plausible.
        I'm a bit worried that I'm now this child's legal guardian or something.
        We are now at an impasse where they won't change the address unless I give them the parent's correct email to change it to.
        Did I mention I'm TOTALLY NOT DOING THIS to avoid the stack of projects I have to grade?
        I have sympathy for both the kid/parents and the underfunded school that no doubt outsourced the system to some vendor.
