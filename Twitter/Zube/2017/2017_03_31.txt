        Automation is awesome. But with great power come great mistakes. One of the biggest you can make is automation of errors.

        When ISPs sell your 'web history,' does that mean a list full URLs? If so, that's a big security issue. URLs often contain session creds.
        And if ISPs seek to profit from selling web history, they're now financially opposed to the adoption of TLS and VPN. That's not good.

        Cool automated project: instrument a browser to load hate sites, do OCR on ads to detect brands, screenshot and forward to marketing depts
        Bottom line on ad tech: much of the money goes to fraud. Brands would be better off targeting ads to content, without any user surveillance
        Targeting ads to content worked really well for a long time. It paid for the Batmobile!
        @slpng_giants is doing a manual version of this via crowdsourcing already. possibly worth talking to them?
        Anyway, browser nerds, this is a good thing to nerd out on. Document the ads that get shown on the prominent hate and disinformation sites
        What @slpng_giants is doing is cool, but from what I can tell limited to Breitbart. List of sites to monitor here: http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/Alt_Narratives_ICWSM17-CameraReady.pdf ... 
        The other thing the paper shows is that it's easy to identify botnets even from outside Twitter. @jack has no excuse http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/Alt_Narratives_ICWSM17-CameraReady.pdf ...

        I think about this all the time.
        Did you know they have to reclaim steel from sunken WWII ships because nuclear isotopes contaminate everything now
        This means that if you went back in time with any metal, and an archaeologist found it, they would know you went back in time.

        Well if you're asking my opinion I would say yes, it is. Not sure why you'd need to go out for dinner for this convo, but that's up to youhttps://twitter.com/mattfobrien/status/847273141025914880 ...

        Mike Pence, an adult who is grown,
        In the late 1990s I asked my Dad how to write a cover letter for my short fiction submissions. He was glad to help out.pic.twitter.com/BV5x7qbjqf
        One impact, (the lesser imo) is that if Pence can't even have a business meeting with a woman not his wife then only men can advance w/him
        If I refused to be alone with men I would have a hard time keeping a job. That men can have decades long careers without women says a lot.
        As someone who is apparently a homing beacon for lonely partnered men, I don't dine alone with male colleagues if I can help it.
        This has hurt my career but saved a bit of my sanity.
        I still dine with married male friends. I might even do that today. But colleagues usually make it weird.
        In my personal experience, it's always the man ruining a good coworker relationship.
        So if y'all could stop doing that, I'd love to go back to talking shop over a good meal. As peers.
