        if you were committed to representing ideological diversity, you'd hire a) a far-right Conway type and b) a leftist Sanders type
        but what upper class libs want is Respectful Discourse that is properly deferential to upper class liberal totems
        therefore, you can't have an unhinged Trump person, and you can't have a dirty hippie who wants a 100% top marginal tax rate
        The NYT op-ed page wants to represent David Brooksian Republicanism, same as it ever was
        and what Stephens shows is that rhetoric aside, climate change is not that important to upper class libs. denial is a Respectable Opinion
        it's of a piece with quickly giving up on cap-and-trade in 2010, and Obama boasting about building 25k miles of pipelines in 2012 debates
        If your subscription sales pitch is that you defend truth, you cant be surprised when people unsubscribe after you publish climate denialism
        but, anyway, defensive NYT people, your business depends on your Brand and your bosses are fucking up your Brand so blame them
