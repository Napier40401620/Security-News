+         He predicts all cars will have gateways between obdii and other ECUs wit

+         Now guy from Lear talking about vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure commun

+         He is concerned the v2x sensor is a potential attack vector for the car.
+   Me too!
+         NHSTA sponsoring a formal verification project to parse the v2x data.
+         He also says, due to spoofing, the v2x sensor should never be trusted al

+         Also, I like 30 minute talk format.  More conferences should do shorter

+         Last talk for me today: nick gill from @Capgemini.  30% of customers say

+         Consumers care almost as much about privacy attacks as they do about cyb

+         In 1923 there were 863,000 coal miners. Mechanization led to a decline i
