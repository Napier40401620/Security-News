        My guess is this: @realDonaldTrump approval ratings are so bad, he's DESPERATE to drop some bombs SOMEWHERE to boost his numbers.
        We're now bombing Syria. No Congressional war declaration.
        Iraq, Libya, Syria. If you're excited about this, you're ineducable.
        The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not!
        It's exciting to think that we're now dramatically closer to winding up in a war with Russia over Syria. #SeriousPeopleAreTheBest
        So glad we have a stable, responsible Commander-in-Chief tin charge of our newest war.
        Congressional declarations of war are now without question de facto unnecessary and entirely optional.
        You want to impeach Trump? How about for a war against another nation with no Congressional authorization? Hilarious, I know
        And yethttps://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/850154988521304064 ... 
        It's almost like this sort of ineducable, lizard brain, masturbatory public reaction is why presidents love to start wars.https://twitter.com/SamSacks/status/850166028738973696 ... 
        And why the Constitution gives that power (LOL) to Congress, not to presidents.
        America likes war. You can hear it on TV. Liberal interventionists, neocons. Dems, GOP. Like Carlin said https://youtu.be/CoTkbwML-zU  #Syria
        This is an act of war. Congress needs to come back into session & hold a debate. Anything less is an abdication of our responsibility.https://twitter.com/cnn/status/850158440240599041 ...

        AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!

        Now starting BugID with @berendjanwever at @InfiltrateCon #youkillityoueatitpic.twitter.com/oZouw4H2jE
        Did I find 1k bugs or 1 bug 1k times? Is this a vuln or a random crash? No one pays for crashes.
        @berendjanwever is evaluating 2500 crashes per day on major browsers. This yields about 1 vuln per month. For a sample, check #DailyBug.
        Dumb fuzzing yields poor results on browsers today. @berendjanwever's fuzzers understand the DOM and coordinate to find complex interactions
        MemGC in IE made 90% of his use-after-free bugs practically unexploitable. "This took a bite out of my income."
        MemGC is not a cure-all. A few UAFs are still exploitable. He's also finding type confusion, out of bounds reads/writes. UAFs are declining.
        BugID automatically performs common crash analysis steps. Goal was make more $ by reporting faster to bounty programs.
        tl;dr Uses WinDBG, Page Heap for UAF. Relies heavily on symbols. Call stack hash and bug type for id. No src req'd, easy to deploy.
        He's collected data on BugID FPs over the last year. Short time between UAF was a typical FP. FNs using BugID are very low.
        This prezi on finding bugs is super awesome ;) #youkillityoueatitpic.twitter.com/zA34wNm7v6
        Great to see the impact of killing bug classes :) Lots of people worked hard to make MemGC happen cc: @msedgedevhttps://twitter.com/jvanegue/status/850368838038323201 ...

        There is nothing more despicable than fake parody Twitter accounts that criticize our overwhelming elected administration.https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/850071656961912832 ... 
        Looking (quickly) over the @ALT_uscis tweets, it's not clear what, if any, crime CBP is investigating here. Clearly marked parody.https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/850072233158615041 ... 
        Realization you're getting old #2182: Covering Florida recount in class today and realizing the students were ~4 years old when it happened.
        N.B: get off my lawn.
        That CBP Twitter subpoena was disturbing enough news for one day. Can we please hold off on the other disturbing stuff for a bit?
        The President has been studying Syria for many years. He's an expert at this point.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/373146637184401408 ... 
        We will handle the conflict with Syria with all the deliberation and expertise you've come to expect from us. Promise.
        Fax header on the CBP Twitter subpoena: "CBP OPR INV OPS". OPR=Office of Professional Responsibility. Internal employee investigations.pic.twitter.com/mWwGzQIcWi
        In an emergency, the President believes that under his authority as commander-in-chief, he can bomb targets without consulting with Putin.
        I will refrain from a snarky comment about how that's "just" metadata.
        Remember, it was CONGRESS that exercised the nuclear option, not us. Today at least.
        I dislike almost everything about Trump (and golf), but I really don't care how often he (or any other POTUS) golfs. People need downtime.
        Yes, he's a hypocrite for having criticized Obama for golfing. But that's hardly my biggest complaint about the guy.
        Disclaimer: I'm a TERRIBLE golfer. I can't even reliably keep the golf stick thing in my hand when I hit the puck.
        Complaining he announced Syrian airstrikes from his golf course trivializes the central problem. Did he leave the bathroom lights on too?

        So basically, we flew 59 (latest count) suicide drones with..omg did they not tell Trump where the camera was?
        Once again, Trump had mic problems.
        So as I was saying.   59 cruise missiles, potentially with penetrating warheads. Contrary to what some are saying , they can crater runways.
        So, you'll excuse me for sighing with relief and saying "At least they were just TLAM-Charlies"
        Russians use Tomahawk strike as an opportunity to neg "combat effectiveness" of TLAM relative to their own cruise missile. #alwaysbeclosing

        Possibly the biggest platform security embarrassment in our industry: OSX and Windows don't natively support AE-2 AES ZIP files.
        Instead, they quietly fall back to ZIP 2.0's horrible CRC stream cipher that cryptographers have broken for sport since '94.
        There is literally no sane answer to "how to encrypt-at-rest and transmit a file between Windows and OSX users". None.
        If you answer starts with "just have both sides install", that's not sane. People WILL NOT DO IT.
        Every pentester knows this, because we've all tried to get SECURITY TEAMS at HUGE CLIENTS to accept encrypted reports.
        Slack points out that RC4-encrypted PDF files are the closest thing we have to cross-platform file encryption.
        It's surprising how few experts know this. "Encrypted" ZIP files that OSX and Windows creates are not actually encrypted.https://twitter.com/pushcx/status/850063242844131328 ...
