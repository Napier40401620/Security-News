        Sorry that after the academic research in 2011 when you said to trust you, and then we hacked the Jeep, I've lost some faith.
        I will say that @GM's Jeff Massimilla seems to consistently be the only auto maker rep who seems to want to work with external researchers.

        Bicentennial Man is smarter than Ghost in the Shell (2017)
        Exactly. You don't even need a VPN your freaky searches are already encrypted.https://twitter.com/rosyna/status/847681313360330754 ... 
        Hey, feel free to link to the Executive Leadership Team page on the website of the VPN you suggest people use. And their postal address.
        You're trying to be anonymous by sending your name and money and internet traffic to anonymous nobodies.
        Hey everybody I discovered this free encrypted VPN tunnel built-in to all web browsers it's called HTTPS and it's free. Incredible.
        Apparently when you use this HTTPS VPN, everything you send over it can't be viewed by your ISP. It uses some math thing called encryption.
        I found out all Google searches, Amazon purchases, and Pornhub usernames are already protected by this free VPN called HTTPS. No credit card
        The solution to privacy isn't 0.05% of ISP users trying to opt-out of the net by paying $8/month to someone promising to fix their problems.
        MANY people seem to be confused: HTTPS protects the full URL and page content. The only thing it doesn't protect is the domain name.
        I hope you all sleep in a weird position and your back hurts tomorrow.
        I'd like to note that my controversial opinions I fight about are nerd stuff and don't profit from and you shouldn't hate me forever. Night

        What line of thinking resulted in Personalized Security Images provide any value on login pages?
        I get the intention, a phishing site can't show a user their personalized image, so the user will know the site isn't real. (in theory)
        But for me at least, the only time I remember the personalized image for a site is when the site shows it to me.
        Ergo, if a site (legit or phishing) didn't show me the image, then I'd never think twice about it.
        So... what's the point? Why add a point of friction to the authentication process with what could be 0% actual value?

        Hey at least the Moments tab hasn't got any worse
        Starting all new tweets with "RE:" to make it clear that they're replies
        Apologies if I'm seeming somehow less well-tempered than usual, this is my first day of using Perforce
        Top hit for perforce tutorial is the official library of tutorial videos
        "Hey guys today we're going to learn how to perform a merge against upstream, don't forget to like, share and subscribe to my channel"
        "....c refers to all files in the current directory and its subdirectories ending in .c"
        What's the Perforce config flag for waking up with the gin already in me because I think I need that one
        "Use this option with caution, as the file revision in the client workspace will be overwritten with no chance of recovery" WHAT YEAR IS IT
        "After you have opened a file, you can lock it so that only you can submit the next revision" OH MY GOD
        Me yesterday: A twitter mention! How wonderful!
        Huh ok "Mute conversation" does actually work

        Right. 13 million of us voted for him because we read fake news stories about HRC murders and body doubles - not because we just disagreed.https://twitter.com/njm4250/status/847619972109025280 ... 
        We were all unwitting traitors, but some of us honestly, is that the idea?https://twitter.com/alshuey/status/847624594315816961 ... 
        Here I thought I agreed with Sanders policies, but it turns out it's just Russians controlling my dumb brain.
        Deep Throat also said: "These aren't very bright guys, and things just got out of hand." That's most "conspiracies" - not ingenious plots.https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/847479791632568320 ... 
        PUTIN MADE ME SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL. I'VE DISGRACED MY COUNTRY!!!
        158 million out of 231 million eligible voters didn't vote Democratic in the general. How many because of Putin do you think?https://twitter.com/jsteinthal/status/847638606390845440 ... 
        And that's a bigger deal than the 157 million people who didn't vote Democratic because they just didn't like the message or care?https://twitter.com/apkamps/status/847640733263712258 ... 
        Exactly. As the one former Sen. aide told me re Dems: "Even Michael Jackson knew to start with the man in the mirror."https://twitter.com/rickandmortys3/status/847642098954158080 ... 
        Yes, and the biggest deal, by a factor of about a thousand at least, was the total incompetence of the Democrats.https://twitter.com/sluhks/status/847642947583488000 ... 
        The same way Obama won despite people calling him a coke-sniffing America-hating Muslim: by being an effective candidate.https://twitter.com/brad_buchsbaum/status/847645022702915584 ... 
        Partially because HRC aides told us reporters that all rumors of her campaign flagging were vicious lies - she had it locked up.https://twitter.com/kdridout/status/847646817500004353 ... 
        Might have been a good idea, then, to not run a candidate with 25 years of baggage in a year when 67% of voters wanted a new direction.https://twitter.com/halsparks/status/847648584522645504 ... 
        Yes, he had the amazing luck to not run while facing criminal investigation.https://twitter.com/niteowl41/status/847649254801784832 ... 
        That's actually more damning - the 67% wanted a new direction even before they heard the direction. All the more reason to avoid a DC lifer.https://twitter.com/halsparks/status/847654400164118531 ... 
        Okay. You're right. Hillary was an amazing candidate. The perfect choice for 2016. It was the Russians who ruined everything. Happy?https://twitter.com/halsparks/status/847656583605534720 ... 
        @mtaibbi All you need to know about how good or bad of a candidate Hillary Clinton was is the simple fact that she lost to Donald Trump.
        No, you're behind two rhetorical cycles; I'm a Russian-sympathizing jerk now. Sexist was last summer.https://twitter.com/odetteroulette/status/847662488157945857 ... 
        Hal Sparks was just in here insisting otherwise.https://twitter.com/brad_buchsbaum/status/847663839910940672 ... 
        And now we're also both traitors. Is there an adjoining suite down there?https://twitter.com/parkism/status/847665994986278913 ...

        TFW a trusted printer runs out of toner and you need to fight temptation to adjust ACLs & switch to another (full of toner, but untrusted)..
        E.g. of why user/admin roles should be separated. And it should be PITA to break this sep (surely more PITA then getting a new toner :)https://twitter.com/rootkovska/status/847761564866420736 ... 
        What makes trusted printer TRUSTED, BTW,  are ACLs (no WAN, limits who can talk with it) & assumption these ACLs won't be lifted in future.
        So for a device like a printer the "trusted" status should be "sticky". This would not be the case if the device was stateless, tho.

        Lesson 1: don't name your secret Twitter account "Reinhold Neibuhr" like nobody in the world who isn't the Director of the FBI would do.
        Lesson 2: If you're the Director of the FBI and Benjamin Wittes follows your secret Twitter account, delete the account.
        And THIS is why the FBI cares about lying-to-the-FBI, misfilling forms, etc.  Give amazing leverage to flip people.https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/847576806307897348 ...
