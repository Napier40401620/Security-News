+         travel you just go naked,  pick up any phone and find your home environm

+         it for BYOD whereby the company has its SecureZones for the employees an
+ d they just connect from their phones into a controlled environment...
+         or, turn it around, and run it as a personal SecureZone on company-issue
+ d phones. Finally you could use it as a "service-issued" zone...
+         where activity within a site, say e-banking, can be strictly controlled
