        If Trump is a Russian operative, then this must be the shittiest coup on record. I think the CIA is professionally offended.

        If you took advice about communications security from the Guardian, please write about your experience on the walls of your holding cell
        @Pinboard Or talk to their ombudsman, if they are in fact in the same cell
        Please help us find the Guardian ombudsman and return him to London. Look for an extremely tan man with a sense of journalistic ethics
        The place that Guardian article form submits to? "guardiannewsampampmedia . formstack . com"
        Check out the gorgeous URL on the Guardian web form that Turkish dissidents are asked to use. Too long to tweet! https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/js.php/untitled_form_19_copy_5_copy_2_copy_copy_copy_1_copy_2_copy_1_copy_1_copy_1_copy_1_copy_1_copy_copy_1_copy_1_copy_1_copy_copy_copy_copy_1_copy_4_copy_copy_copy_copy ... 
        Just to give you a taste: "forms/js.php/untitled_form_19_copy_5_copy_2_copy_copy_copy_1_copy_2_copy_1_copy_1_copy_1_copy_1_copy_1_copy_... "
        The source HTML of that Guardian page also says "Now Hiring", presumably inserted by whatever web dev got promoted to Guardian editor
        Don't trust the Guardian with sensitive info. Don't talk to Guardian tech reporters. The place is a clown car on fire
        @Pinboard you could ask the vacationing ombudsman if Guardian sets up encryption and PGP when using @Formstack
        @Pinboard Looks like the domain name stands for "Guardian News &amp;amp; Media".
        @Pinboard I bet the whole site goes down if you actually type in Turkish.

        I wonder, is @KathViner aware that 70 (!) cryptographers signed an open letter to retract that whatsapp story? Cc @Pinboard @zeynephttps://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/832259292606533632 ... 
        .@KathViner how many cryptographers do you need signing @zeynep's letter for the Guardian to respond? We'll get themhttp://technosociology.org/?page_id=1687 
        .@KathViner also happy to round up volunteers to find and bring your ombudsman back from his extended holiday. We're eager to help.
        The choice before the Guardian is clear: retract its terrible WhatsApp stories, or continue to be pilloried by an online bookmarking site
        By the way, Pinboard is a good bookmarking site! Use Pinboard!

        Are there any ongoing efforts to run unmodified POSIX apps (e.g. a Web browser) within an SGX enclave? (Ok if recompilation required).
        Better yet: to run a @docker container as SGX enclave(s)? :)
        Note I'm familiar with Microsoft's Drawbridge papers (which are useless for all of us, because: no code available).
        A big day for us, we are proud to announce that Inverse Path is now part of F-Secure.
        An interesting paper about putting Linux apps into SGX enclaves and run as docker containers (h/t @jessfraz):
        They use encryption syscall proxy (shield) for (select) file and network I/O. Unclear how protect apps from other syscalls?
        (Even though other syscalls might not be returning any sensitive data, the app (in the enclave) still needs to parse the results...)
        Other limitations: 1) no remote attestation support (so, mostly useless in production), 2) no fork/exec. But these seems workaround-able.
        (Of course this is all for server applications, useless for desktop currently, because no trusted human input and output)
        Perhaps. Yet we all do that routinely, don't we? super-humans -> we, sub-humans -> animals. Unless you believe all humanists are vegans ;)https://twitter.com/ttaskett/status/832248599589314560 ...
