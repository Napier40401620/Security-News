        Lovemaking is one of the best ideas Satan put in the apple he gave to Eve. The best idea in that apple, though, is making jazz.
        Maturity is a bitter disappointment for which no remedy exists, unless laughter can be said to remedy anything.
        Life happens too fast for you ever to think about it. If you could just persuade people of this, but they insist on amassing information.

        Still working on a venue for an event tomorrow in Seattle. You guys are a resistant town.
        Not all social problems can be solved with a website or HOWTO. Some of them, quite frankly, need an app
        And there are some social problems that are resistant to simple technological fixes, no matter how clever. For those, we have the blockchain
        "I have here in my hand a list of 205 zero-day vulnerabilities that were known to the Director of Central Intelligence"
        Our Seattle meetup will be tomorrow at 6:30 PM at the Labor Temple (!). Event page imminent.
        "Here are my children with the man who called me a liar, called my wife ugly, and called my father an assassin. I am so very dead inside."https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/839805100327649280 ...

        Only Google would be arrogant enough to create an API for scrubbing private data, while assiduously collecting it everywhere else
        Sorry, that last tweet is completely wrong. There are about seven companies arrogant enough to do that
        Odd how Google can do amazing things like "build API for identifying private data" but won't make end-to-end secure email, or a safe phone

        If you're not willing to remove a toxic contributor from your project, you are accepting toxic behavior as a cultural norm.
        Also happened:
        A while ago, I was at a meetup of a tech I'm very involved in. I sat down & a guy next to me said "oh! you must have just started coding!"
        I said to the guy, "I've been coding for almost 15 years"
        He said "You can't have, that's longer than me!"
        For years I would to to confs decked in company swag, stand in the company booth, and have men go "do you REALLY work for $COMPANY?"
        One time a man refused to believe I was an engineer. "You're too good at demos. Are you a PM? Manager?"
        Another time a man didn't like my answer to something, so he turned to a male support engineer and said "are YOU technical?"
        The support engineer told him I was the only engineer there, and the guy got huffy and left.

        Exploit kits: Winter 2017 reviewhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/03/exploit-kits-winter-2017-review/ ... 

matthewstoller

        Not an exaggeration. I can see this coming already in TX and LAhttps://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/840203501082927106 ... 
        17. Ppl still don't get what's coming, just like in 2008 or 2010 they didn't anticipate the right populist revolt when it was preventable.
        18. If your response is 'the Dem party doesn't get it we're going to destroy them' ask yourself why you keep losing.
        19. Bernie lost. Ellison lost. And if you're third party, how did that go? Enjoy your 2% of the vote? This is not just a Dem elite problem.
        @matthewstoller I'm watching England intensely lately, I know there's differences but the scenario you've just laid out is happening now
        20. Yes, it's been building for 40 years. It's autocracy, and the only way to stand against it is populismhttps://twitter.com/WillMcJ/status/840208288671236096 ... 
        21. Yup. The excuses of the Clinton wing for the general are the same for the Bernie wing for the primary. RIGGED!https://twitter.com/morri_mike/status/840209108766720001 ... 
        22. I point out solutions all the time. I'm an optimist. But solutions start with no longer living in fantasy land.https://twitter.com/bwreed/status/840208766352183296 ... 
        23. And when things get bad, they can get really really bad. Not just @Chris_arnade narrative or immigration ban bad, but starvation bad.
        24. This is the political solution in case you're wondering. Not Bernie wing. Not Clinton wing. Party of the people. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-party-future-rural_us_58b7089ee4b019d36d0fecb4?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009 ... pic.twitter.com/w9gLoi40wY
        25. Why do I think there's interest among Obama/Clinton folks on taking on power? Because Clinton talked about antitrust and market power.
        26. So in other words... nothing matters. Another excuse, the left-wing version of Comey/Russia/etc.https://twitter.com/who4fan/status/840214354314330112 ... 
        27. Clinton did not have to mention market power. She wanted to b/c a faction in her camp bought into it.https://twitter.com/PhilNista/status/840215081896026113 ... 
        28. What makes you think that everyone in power is benefitting from monopoly power?https://twitter.com/DanielHofheinz/status/840215394468134912 ... 
        Near the end of a good thread but this article is terrific, provides a clear and reasonable path forward for many peoplehttps://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/840211731636969472 ... 
        Ok. And who was President from 2009 onward? B/c he seemed to have 80-90%+ approval ratings among those voters.https://twitter.com/LadyReverb/status/840222908018384896 ... 
        @matthewstoller There are definitely people within the Obama wing that do care about this. October CEA report was on monopsony in the labor market.
        @matthewstoller @cenkuygur Bernie is wrong, as a Trump supporter I think the DNC should keep doubling down.
        Dems actually have regulatory appointments they can make on commissions. What will Schumer do? https://theintercept.com/2017/03/10/as-trump-neuters-regulatory-commissions-chuck-schumer-needs-to-decide-if-he-will-fight-or-give-in/ ... pic.twitter.com/Qw9TPsJqa8
        Worth remembering Obama promised Americans their health care cost would go down, not "grow slower" but down http://www.democracycorps.com/attachments/article/1063/Dcor_Macomb_FG%20Memo_3.10.2017_FINAL.pdf ... pic.twitter.com/KmjeKi8ezm

        I would be interested (perhaps the only person interested) in a long-form piece exploring how Confide got so much uptake in DC.
        Speaking as sort of an expert: Confide came out of nowhere to me after the election, and I looked at it and my drink came out my nose.
        Wanted: elisp snippet that converts a grep-mode document to an org-mode checklist.
        Why is my timeline full of some book report from the CIA about 90s security but nothing being mentioned about the Marines going to Syria?
