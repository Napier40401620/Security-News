        "Tell me again about the Mac Pro, George"
        Hey @gruber, I have an amazing set of updates to Pinboard to share. Fresh API, better filters. Not this year, though. Please tell the world!
        This is very good news for serious Mac users, who will have another chance to buy a gorgeous premium product that gets abandoned for years
        real reason mac pros are not shipping yet: can't figure out how to incorporate touchbar pro into it
        Remember three days ago when he was making fun of someone publicizing a render of an unshipped product?http://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/04/01/frommer-galaxy-s8 ... 
        Buried lede from the Apple @gruber puppet show: "I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will. " I will not.
        Who could have guessed "tightly-packed top hat from space" is not the ideal configuration for a professional-level video editing server
        I think of it as 'vertical jet engine plowing into the floor'
        "It's gonna be the best MacPro ever. It's a very good MacPro. It's the best MacPro."
        Someone tell @gruber to be careful not to get used by Apple, lest he jeopardize his reputation as a dispassionate, impartial critic
        We're going to build a big, beautiful heat sink, and have Mexico pay for it
        The new Mac Pro will solve its thermal challenges by blowing hot air directly into Daring Fireball
        My burning question about the next Mac Pro: will it be powerful enough to render its own 17.5 megabyte homepage?http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/ 
        The shape of the next Mac Pro as described by @gruberpic.twitter.com/okfugSMEEX
        Ok, last one. You know what can easily solve Mac Pro's heating problems? Nugget ice.https://nuggetice.com/ 
        Awesome, 6 slack channels, twitter, mastodon, and only 5 private messengers. Keeping up with friends has never been easier!

        GlÃ¼ckwunsch #Telekom euer #StreamOn war ja Mal marketingtechnisch der letzte scheiÃŸ. Viel SpaÃŸ beim shitstorm. Werde mich auch beteiligen
        Telekoms neuer #StreamOn Tarif ist aus mehreren Aspekten bullshit. 1. Gilt der Tarif nicht wenn das Datenvolumen aufgebraucht ist ..
        2. Geht der Tarif nur fÃ¼r L Tarife die sowieso schon ein hohes Datenvolumen haben #StreamOn
        3. BeschrÃ¤nkt sich der Tarif auf wenige Anbieter und untergrÃ¤bt damit NetzneutralitÃ¤t.
        4. Die Voraussetzungen fÃ¼r eine #StreamOn  Partnerschaft sind schwammig.
        5. Telekom nutzt ziemlich klar seine Monopolstellung aus. Frag mich ja wie das Kartellamt das sieht. #StreamOn
        6. Ist der Tarif #StreamOn komplett daran vorbei was die Benutzer wirklich wollen. NÃ¤mlich Aufhebung des Datenvolumens.
        Was Deutschen Firmen fehlt ist Verantwortung und RÃ¼ckgrat zu beweisen und Mal umsatz auÃŸen vor zu lassen um die Welt besser zu machen.

        My twitter feed is now about the Windows Registry.
        Because HKCU takes precedence over HKLM in HKCR, operations that assume the security integrity of HKCR keys are fundamentally flawed.
        The purpose of HKCR is to allow transparent programmatic view of HKLM classes, with the ability for users to override preferences in HKCU.
        HKCR is like a combination Taco Bell/Pizza Hut.
        It's a solution from the 90's for a problem nobody wants to have.
        "It's 2AM, and I want a pizza, but I also want a taco, but I don't want to have to go to two places."
        I'm not good at explaining things.

        porting stuff to different languages really is an entirely different skillset.
        makes you really think about a language's design and how to remodel code written for one language to another. Definitely a good exercise
