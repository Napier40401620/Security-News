        They got fined for misleading info, not for the acquisition per se. That  is even scarier: the EU was fine with it anyway!
        So Facebook has learned they can openly lie to European regulators about privacy practices and get away with it. This should end well.

        Front-end people of Twitter: when you are teaching newbies HTML and Javascript, what is the progression you use? What tools/tutorials?
        I learned HTML by cut-and-paste and HotWired articles, but I'm assuming that's no longer the way it's taught
        Of course, the correct way to learn front-end development is still by recursively reading through the relevant RFCs
        Just learn how to vertically center elements with CSS and everything else will naturally follow.
        The worst mistake the web ever made was improving Javascript performance in the browser
        I'm not sure it's possible to learn anymore, you can only keep doing it.

        "Oil change in 27 days" says my Audi. Guess what it will say tomorrow.
        I wonder if Audi can survive the transition to teslamorphic cars. They have to figure out software too, and in software they're in 1985.
        The Tesla Model S was like the iPhone in that all other manufacturers now have to copy it. The difference is many don't realize that yet.
        There's no analog to Android in this situation. That gives Tesla an advantage that Apple didn't have.
        It's possible to imagine a future in which few other car manufacturers survive. Not saying that will happen, but remarkable it's possible.

        Dear @Zomato, so you say you follow PCI DSS and yet think a dev machine got compromised and data got leaked? Production data on dev systems?
        Also hashing? Was it bcrypt or equivalent? Significant percent of hashes could be cracked thru rainbow tables. Asking as a concerned user 
        Somehow this blog post doesn't makes a lot of sense to me. Unless it is updated with more details.

        Wondering if [EDR SOFTWARE REDACTED] which is a .NET assembly, is susceptible to .NET Profiler Hijack? Probably. ;-)
        Anyone have .NET guidance on preventing your application from being profiled? 
        MSDN guidance I can find on Profiler Security.
