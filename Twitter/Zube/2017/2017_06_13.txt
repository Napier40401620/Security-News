        I'll give a pack of chocolates to @alexstamos about his great point regarding information sharing and the need of openess. #FIRSTCON17
        talk from @alexcpsec at #FIRSTCON17 has good points for maliciousness ratio calculation. Can we improve the current bgpranking ranking algo?

        I looked at rough costs in the legitimate economy. OFC attackers can steal too. The value of the slide is: We want top right for future IoCs

        I'm astonished at how casually some people are dismissing the notion that NSA bribes academics. Why wouldn't they? http://www.d.umn.edu/~jgallian/PURMweb/NSA.pdf ... 
        The documentation shows, e.g., NSA's "sabbatical program to allow mathematicians to visit us while retaining their academic affiliation."
        The same NSA ad mentions "a few million dollars annually" ("a large portion of our technology budget"?!?) for "academic research proposals".
        Coppersmith, Buhler, Gordon made big advances in NFS etc. Then they were offered money by NSA's pet company IDA. No more papers since then.
        Of course the money was packaged as lucrative job offers, which means there's nothing scandalous here, right? Nothing to worry about, right?
        And _of course_ the public community will quickly rediscover all of the attacks that Coppersmith et al. secretly discovered. We're so smart!

        Complete misunderstanding example (of both my intention, and threat model):https://twitter.com/qwazix/status/874034610807721984 ... 
        Very true & very disappointing. Also contrasts with how we -
        Windows RS3 19093+ Introduce "DMA Guard" which uses GUID_CONSOLE_LOCKED and Session Notifications to disable DMA at the lock screen.
        Only a few more and it'll be just like on Qubes ;)
        But to be fair: only Qubes 4.1 (i.e. when we introduce full GUI domain) will be protected against DMA from malicious GPU devices.
        Normally this is not a problem, since GPU often part of the CPU package, so need to be trusted anyway. However...
        But attackers might exploit DP to force GPU to DMA? And proper way to cut this is via GUIdom, not by disabling DMA on lock screen, IMHO.
