        Well 20% detected some...https://twitter.com/InfosecEditor/status/872101558221021184 ... 
        "Kremlin denies Russian hackers breached US voting software firm". Was anyone expecting, "Kremlin confirms Russian hackers breached..."?

        It seems though authorities would have identified Winner regardless of the print dots or the second contractor; more for sources to learn
        Judging by court docs, print dots and paper crease really make little difference. Checking who searched doc first thing you do regardless
        Affidavit does include a lot of stuff that seems to shift blame onto Intercept. Shorter version w/o: she searched for and printed the doc
        Related: difference between what info you need to identify someone, and what you need to prosecute. Affidavit obv closer to the latter.
        Lessons:

        I'm not sure if this is surprising or not, but it seems notable.
        This is not, by the way, a ban.
        NSA report says 122 (unnamed) local gov't election officials were sent mal email, but doesn't discuss any forensics done on their networks.
        It looks like NSA's investigation chiefly involved analysis of the gmail accounts used for the spearphishing, but not the targets' systems.
        That may be due to NSA lacking authority to do investigations on US systems; I wonder if FBI/DHS/etc was also investigating.
        In any case, that leaked document is both very interesting and clearly not the full story, And county election systems REALLY need audits.
        Note that that NSA report was written only a month ago; it's possible that the investigation continues, including audits of those systems.
        Final thought: in 2007, we found hundreds of exploitable vulnerabilities in voting systems. Emailing malware to voting officials is easier.
        1/Winner case illustrates limitations of anonymous submission to protect sources. Intercept's attempt to authenticate apparently did her in.
        2/2 Obvious Q is whether Winner would have been safer as a known source, who could have discussed her particular risks w journalists.

        What I want is EVM, but for an arbitrary set of extended attributes
        What I *don't* want is a build-time kernel option that decides whether the fs UUID is part of the EVM data
        Look all I'm asking is why Ikea, of all places in the US, doesn't have frames matted for A2
        It's about 10PM, my partner's in Tokyo, I've been to Ikea and hung a pair of curtains on my own. Of course I have thoughts on The Intercept.
        First: It is clear that in this case the leaker was going to get caught if the story was published, no matter how careful the journalists.
        But there are legitimate questions. The printer dot thing isn't new. Could steps have been taken to avoid that?
        Was providing an apparently unredacted copy to a government employee for verification unavoidable?
        But, more importantly: https://theintercept.com/leak/  is almost silent on covering most of your tracks.
        It's a document that goes into detail on how to anonymously communicate, but doesn't cover basics like "Is this material access controlled?"
        Documents that are heavy on detail in one respect and light in another give readers the impression that that stuff doesn't matter
        Other than having emailed The Intercept on an apparently separate matter, Reality Winner seems to have done everything listed on that page
        Now yes *we* know that there are many other things to worry about, but when a user follows the documentation and loses anyway that's *bad*
        If you have a page that encourages people to break the law, you owe it to them to provide enough information to help them assess the risks
        Information on who you'll show it to to verify it. Information on whether you'll make a best effort attempt to redact metadata or not.
        When you're documenting a process that could land someone in jail for the rest of their life (or worse), your documentation should be *good*
        (Yes this has all been a long parable about the state of the tech industry)
        Everything about https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/06/alberta-sexual-assault-victim-jail-investigation ...  is horrifying (sexual assault, violence)
        (Canada is not, it transpires, perfect)
        Documentation gives people the data they need to give informed consent to a process. Bad documentation means that consent wasn't informed.
        Living with someone who's written documentation professionally has really changed my perceptions on its importance.
