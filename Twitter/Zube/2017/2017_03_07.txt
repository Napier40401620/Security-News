        Don't know how to feel about the fact that my undergrad tech policy students have a deeper understanding of wiretap law than the President.
        If Trump thinks Obama could unilaterally order wiretaps as President, does that mean he thinks he can order them now, too?
        Trump's craztytweets are the command and control channel for DoS attacks on substantive discussion of policy.
        Not that "is POTUS becoming unhinged" isn't a substantive policy question, but it would be nice to focus on something else occasionally.
