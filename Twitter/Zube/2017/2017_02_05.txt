        I am (in)famous for my opposition to soft mitigations - many do not stop attackers, but add unnecessary (and risky) complexity. Data point:
        https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/c4e490cf148e85ead0d1b1c2caaba833f1d5b29f ... 
        In short: If your mitigation doesn't stop the bug dead (/GS in some cases) but merely shakes the table of the artist, it will be hard to ...
        ... convince me of the value of the mitigation.
        It kills some, completely. And it is easy to describe which ones it kills. Much less clear cut for random heap randomizations.
        This.https://twitter.com/taviso/status/827616419206410240 ... 
        @halvarflake "...but it raises the bar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" /me rolls eyes.

        Of the news this week, I think I'm most rattled by CBP tricking people into signing away their green cards. Retail-level official cruelty.
        ...  More than anything else this week, that's what I see when I think of the banality of evil.
        .@mattblaze Arguably, then, you're most rattled by the sort of petty-official evil that happens every day.
        Are we sure it was purely retail-level & not directed by the Bannon/Trump White House?https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/827703671282614273 ...

        That the President would dismissively refer to a "so-called" federal judge is positively chilling.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827867311054974976 ... 
        One can only wonder what happens if he loses a so-called "appeal".

        Exercise for the reader: the @realDonaldTrump tweets that don't later get retweeted by the "official" @POTUS account.
        Previously uncontroversial statements:
        The Netherlands will count all ballots by hand to avoid their system being hacked in next month's election, Interior Ministry spox tells CNN
        You so-called reporters from the so-called media need to get with the so-called program.
        I never thought I'd be looking back on the Nixon administration as the model for our system of checks and balances.

        I wish @realDonaldTrump had made clear during the campaign that he might not treat federal judges with deep respect.
        This 'qualified' adjective needs to be retired for a bit. It would be good if a non-judge and non-Ivy Leaguer went on the Supreme Court.pic.twitter.com/hpYJH5Szrj
        Being a Justice should be not about whether you got A's in school. Gorsuch believes in civility among elites and autocracy for the peasants.
        Also, respect for judges isn't a divine right, it is earned. The judiciary has been disgraceful for years. The Supreme Court is very bad.
        Put someone on the court who has fought against power. That makes for justice. Otherwise you're just selecting for cocktail party skill.
        Gorsuch's key decisions are around money in politics, regulation and antitrust. He just doesn't believe in democracy. The rest is noise.
        @matthewstoller Mentor of mine in  public defender's office refused to call judges "your honor" b/c " Constitution forbids honorary titles"
        Also one thing citizens can do is stop using titles. No more Senator, Congressman, Your Honor, General, etc.https://twitter.com/PintDiaries/status/827900533599932416 ... 
        Remember that the Supreme Court ratified a coup in 2000. It's long past time for a serious Congressional investigation of the judiciary.
        Both Lincoln and FDR attacked Supreme Court supremacy. Maybe they had reasons.

        Extreme Vetting, But Not for Banks - Rolling Stonehttp://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/extreme-vetting-but-not-for-banks-w464966 ... 
        The most absurd part was Trump calling for a repeal of the carried interest tax break. Now he's taking advice from Steve Schwarzman... (1/2)https://twitter.com/simulacrandrew/status/827651734508011524 ... 
        (2/2)... Schwarzman once described the idea of repealing the carried interest tax break as being "like when Hitler invaded Poland."https://twitter.com/simulacrandrew/status/827651734508011524 ... 
        What was absurd was the idea that he would ever actually do it. Doesn't seem terribly likely now.https://twitter.com/bea_johanssen/status/827663453867368449 ... 
        Of course. They all promise it, and magically it somehow never happens.https://twitter.com/realbenshapero/status/827663987563061248 ... 
        The carried interest break really is more about calling personal compensation for private equity pros something it isn't; it's income.https://twitter.com/pentatronic/status/827666086069989376 ...

        New iPhone. Moving all my TOTP from Google Authenticator iOS app to @duosec app. Some observations:
        With @digitalocean I have to disable 2FA,  then re-enable. REQUIRED to provide phone & verify 6char alpha num by SMS first.
        Small UX benefit with @duosec : icons for the various services.
        Also no visible countdown for TOTP codes in @duosec app, compared to Google Authenticator. Different. Miss it.
        2FA options + reconfig @github seem really good! Forced print/download of recovery keys, option to remove SMS fallback...
        security key (U2F) support @github, & the latest pwd reset stuff connected to @facebook (by @hillbrad). Me like a lot!
        Hm. My friends @GetCrypho, I'm gonna call you over the weekend. We need to talk risk/UX.
        Finding correct page to change TOTP config @Microsoft wasn't obvious at all, compared to previous ones.
        Oh, and my @duosec entry for @kickstarter *only* displays my email in the duo app. No icon, no service name. yuck.
        That felt *weird*.
        TOTP 2FA @Peerio is as elementary as it gets. Had to disable, then reenable. Kudos for asking new TOTP to disable 2FA.
        No printable backup codes, no sms fallback, no ... nothing @Peerio
        But now I'm 20 minutes past midnight. Enough 2FA, getting up again in 6,5hrs to be live on TV about cozybear messing with us Norwegians.
