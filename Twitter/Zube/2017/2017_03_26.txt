        "far and away my favorite book is Atlas Shrugged, and it's probably not an accident that all the heroes in Atlas Shrugged are also pilots"
        "If you love Earth, you should love Boom because it makes [... ] it easier to access the wonderful places and people Earth has to offer."
        @Pinboardpic.twitter.com/LVminx6NFX
        That last gem is from the lovely Boom supersonic FAQ http://boomsupersonic.com/faq/ 
        Boom "requires just a 30% efficiency improvement over Concorde's 50 year-old airframe and engines," which were a masterpiece of engineering
        I try not to play favorites and enjoy seeing all YC startups fail equally, but I'm going to make a special exception for Boom
        Little-known fact Boom won't talk about: if you use in-flight wifi on a supersonic plane, everything in your browser reads backwards
        Boom in a nutshell: Groupon employee decides he can beat Concorde performance by a factor of 1.3, because he has passion. YC gives him money
        @Pinboard BTW, they were not pilots. They were a railroad CEO, a steel mill owner, a composer, and an engineer.
        I gave a talk a couple of years ago that was partly about why we don't have supersonic airliners: http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm ... 
        Please note that my argument is not: "supersonic airlines are impossible", or "don't try big ideas". My argument is "these guys are asshats"
        @Pinboard concorde failed cause the french partners refused to eat ramen
        If you're into Concorde history, there is a fantastic thread by the designers/pilots. Warning: will eat your day. http://www.pprune.org/tech-log/423988-concorde-question.html ... 
        @Pinboard "enable an ultra-fast airliner as efficient and affordable as business class" <-- this "affordable" bit is a big FU too.
        @Pinboard so aviation geeks like my,own @sbisson tell me it's not the engineering, it's the flight experience compromises
        Best supersonic airliner ever was the Tu-144: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-144 ...  The captain ordered the navigator to stuff a pillow in the alarm siren
        @Pinboard "WHO IS ERNST MACH?"
        @Pinboard I worked on the space shuttle and I feel like the two programs have a lot of similarities. Very mixed feelings about both.
        Supersonic airliners would take 3 hours off transatlantic flying time for the rich. Airport security reform would do the same for everybody
        @Pinboard Sounds hard. It'd be easier to just shave more time off the supersonic flight by not decelerating before landing

        Per https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/us/politics/health-care-affordable-care-act.html ...  it's apparently the Democrats' fault that Trump couldn't get enough Republican votes for his bill...

        If only there'd been a Dem candidate who ran on this in 2016. One this same writer hated & sniped at constantly. Hmmhttps://twitter.com/jesseberney/status/845415459864432641 ... 
        "Bernie woulda won" meme seems designed to remind Dems to not cheer next time a coronated Dem frontrunner campaigns against Medicare-for-all
        A year ago, Hillary Clinton was campaigning against single payer, and many Dems cheered http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-single-payer-health-care-will-never-ever-happen/ ... https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/845473691840512001 ... 
        So basically all the Dem pundits, operatives, DC politicians & consultants who hate Sanders represent a whopping 8% of their party.https://twitter.com/ryanlcooper/status/845487531676327936 ... 
        She campaigned against single payer, had her people attack his character & hes now America's most popular politician. He owes her nothing.https://twitter.com/tommyxtopher/status/845446517259452416 ... 
        Idea: when you use establishment power to crush a primary & then lose a general to a reality star, ur no longer entitled to effusive praise
        Clintons' combined legacy: Wall St dereg, NAFTA, welfare reform, vote for Iraq War, railing on single payer, losing to reality TV star.
        The only shocking thing is that anyone is shocked that many progressives don't like this & don't ever want it again.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/845649086585954304 ... 
        The best part of 2016 was the Dem's campaign citing its support from Iraq War proponents & pro-torture loons as reason she was the sane pick
        Trump is weakened, Obamacare is delivering high premiums -- under the circumstances, Dems refusal to push Medicare-for-all is really telling
        This is what lockstep loyalty to the for-profit health insurance industry looks like in practicehttps://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/845651671564931072 ... 
        I think Trump "enablers" = propagandists paid by Clinton donors to prevent Dems from nominating a more popular & electable 2016 candidatehttps://twitter.com/tommyxtopher/status/845649445857476608 ... 
        Overton Window = Dems shunning Medicare-for-all & instead celebrating the preservation of massive taxpayer subsidies to Aetna execs
        This seems like a good point https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/03/trump-pelosi-clinton-resistance-movement-russia-maddow/ ... pic.twitter.com/wmMEY6y1xQ
        Hes the most popular pol in America, after you and your donors spent months attacking his character & then lost to a reality TV starhttps://twitter.com/tommyxtopher/status/845653243841691650 ... 
        Clinton shills' assertion that Bernie's 40-yr-old essay "woulda killed him" seems belied by election of Donald "Grab Her By The Pussy" Trumphttps://twitter.com/tommyxtopher/status/845653243841691650 ... 
        When even a Fox poll shows Sanders the most popular pol in America, that's an extra validation. But you knew that. You mad, bro?https://twitter.com/tomwatson/status/845656477822013440 ...

        This is mind blowingly obtuse. It completely fails to understand how hard it is for ppl to speak about these things.
        When you are living in a toxic situation such as that, you try to normalize it for yourself, it's not until you leave you see it for real
        It often takes a long time to see it as it truly was, and there's a bunch of other factors like if you were friends etc, it's complicated
        Basically when you are living in it, you minimalize, internalize so that it won't get worse or people won't judge... just until you can GTFO
