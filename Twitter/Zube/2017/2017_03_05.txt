        Graphics programmers, I expect you to take note of this.
        In case anyone forgot why Uber/Lyft are cheaper than taxis, it's because a VC is spotting you 30% of your fare... until competition dies.https://twitter.com/triketora/status/837171024106033152 ... 
        Browser exploit mitigations & JS comes down to picking 2 of these:
        Stop calling this administration's atrocities "distractions". This is a full attack on multiple fronts and we need to confront them all.
        Today at #GDC17, there was a talk on "ultra low budget" indie game dev... that required the $1,000+ Main Conference pass to attend??

        Don't forget that PSP isn't the only closed-source part of AMD CPU. SMU was there long before, and it's closed too: https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/system/attachments/2503/original/ccc-final.pdf ... 
        @NikolajSchlej wrote some interesting notes about recent news on @AMD and opensourcehttps://twitter.com/NikolajSchlej/status/837751682226405379 ... 
        Don't say "human error" for S3 outage. Sure, maybe someone fat-fingered the thing, but it's a process/policy issue. I got your back, DevOps.
        "Culture" - on a national level, on a corporate level, on a private level - permeates all decisionmaking but is so poorly understood.

        "Culture" - on a national level, on a corporate level, on a private level - permeates all decisionmaking but is so poorly understood.
        Most actions bigger groups take cannot be explained rationally except through the prism of culture. Changing or upholding culture seems ...
        ... super poorly understood, especially in presence of rapid growth.
        As of today, I have Swiss permanent residency <3. Yay. Also sun is shining.
        In case this seemed ranty: It was not, at all -- it was rather triggered by reading the NZZ article discussing US culture.

        The Metadata is the Message: NYPD Transit Bureau used MetroCard records &cell tower dumps in graffiti investigation,http://nypdnews.com/2017/03/transit-bureau-officers-bust-notorious-graffiti-vandal/ ... 
        Note that in general, cell tower registration and transit card swipe records can be obtained with a simple subpoena, a low legal standard.
        @mattblaze sounds familiar -- old story, new use (sigh)https://www.wired.com/2013/06/phew-it-was-just-metadata-not-think-again/ ... 
        More of these kinds of records about our movements are being created every day. Obtaining & processing them only gets cheaper and easier.
        So what might have been used to investigate a murder yesterday is used for graffiti today, and will be used for <YOUR ANSWER HERE> tomorrow.
        It's surveillance creep; few oppose using data to investigate serious crimes, but once the floodgates are open, they're open wide.
        And if you say "just switch up your Metro Card and get a burner phone when you go tagging", well, good luck with that.
        No.https://twitter.com/CharlieOneTime/status/837839761175781376 ... 
        I live and breathe this stuff professionally, and I would have no idea how to reliably & practically evade this kind of surveillance today.

        I will be very interested to read the affidavit for the T3/FISA wiretap order on Trump, which I assume he will be promptly declassifying.
        Or, if no such order exists, I look forward to the forthcoming indictment of the FBI agents for illegal wiretapping.
        Either way. Your move, Mr. President.
        I have this image in my head of Trump playing a saxophone, having just ripped up the floorboards of the Oval Office looking for bugs.
