        The only quote that hangs in my cube. Said by Claude Shannon, "father of information theory."pic.twitter.com/v4V9HodALO
        In everything I have come across in security, there is nothing as beautifully trancendent as Kerckhoff's principle. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs's_principle ... pic.twitter.com/LBdJVpqVzP
        We are, from a young age, indoctrinated with the idea that imperviousness of human systems are sourced in a fundamental way from obscurity.
        What social customs do you have to practice, what jargon do you have to effortlessly parry, what confidence do you need to appear to conform
        Then, marvelousness, to see a system whose performative protocols were irrelevant. Whose protection was bound to a core mote of knowledge.
        A reusable set of instructions that needn't discrete secrecy or any re-invention. Only a small, changeable key, able to protect any length.
        For most of human history, the secrecy of information was solely sourced from simple substitution, tradecraft, and the power of the state.
        Strong, seamless cryptography means we live an exceptional time. Perhaps not exceptional to those in the future, but to those in the past.
        This was a gift to me in my Junior year of high school. It's not about math, it's about our relationship to secrets.https://www.amazon.com/Code-Book-Science-Secrecy-Cryptography/dp/0385495323 ... 
        @rtphokie @SwiftOnSecurity As Whit Diffie told me one time, "You have to be able to change the key." Sadly, it is too often impossible.
        Imagine having no encryption, so you shave a man's head, tattoo orders on his scalp, wait for hair to regrow, and send him past enemy lines.
        Information security of the past was information obscurity.
        I too got this book in high school. It is a must read.https://twitter.com/swiftonsecurity/status/818669715539247104 ... 
        @SwiftOnSecurity This book is excellent. I've recommended it several times since you mentioned it last year.

        Trump is destructive & anomalous in many ways. But its not helpful to pretend everything bad in society was singularly created by him (1/x)
        In many cases, it may be more accurate to contextualize Trump as a reflection of different societal trends that led to his ascension (2/x)
        Trump sure seems intent on exacerbating many of those destructive trends, but it's not helpful to pretend he created all of them (3/3)

        Rumor is that the Old Executive Office Building, where most WH staff work, is virtually empty. No one's home in the Trump Presidency.
        John McCain got his start as a reformer by condemning his own bribe-taking from bank exec Charles Keating in the 1980s. Maverick!
        Of course 4 out of the 5 "Keating Five" Senators caught in the corruption scandal were actually Democrats. So it was bipartisan.
        More important statement on the press this week than Trump's 'enemy of the people' bit is this Mark Zuckerberg essay https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10154544292806634 ... 
        Sure, disagree with Trump that he inherited "a mess" as President, but then explain why such a happy contented country elected Trump.
        Not as he describes it, no. But the drop in white mortality rates is a catastrophe. Brexit/Greece is a catastrophe.https://twitter.com/_barretme/status/832984908507197441 ... 
        Trump's description of the mess isn't accurate. But he acknowledged a mess. Few others in either party did.https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/01/12/democrats-cant-win-until-they-recognize-how-bad-obamas-financial-policies-were/?utm_term=.afcf450102d9 ... 
        Elizabeth Warren: "Our moment of crisis didn't begin with the election of Donald Trump. We were already in crisis."http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-congressional-progressives_us_5895e6b5e4b0406131373015 ... 
        The mess is 40 years of concentrated power in the hands of financiers, and everyone else getting the shaft.http://theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710/ ... 
        Will Trump fix it? No, he'll make it worse. But did Obama fix it? No, his Geithner/Summers cabinet also made it worse. That's just reality.
        @matthewstoller surely you meant the increase in white mortality rates is a catastrophe.
        Comey, electoral college, etc - yes huge problems. They do not explain the 1000+ Dem state legislators losing over the past eight years.
        History's pretty clear. When the center-right and center-left do not deliver/protect liberty and communities, swamp creatures emerge.
        And this is a *global* problem. So please explain how the American electoral college is causing a rising right authoritarianism in Europe.
        @matthewstoller the far right is on the rise globally. Trump is part of that wave. People should look for the common factors.
        Did Americans suddenly turn racist in 2016? Or was it the mismanagement of the greatest financial collapse in 80 years? Hmm. I wonder.
        The angry reactions to the idea that there might have been a few things wrong prior to 2016 reminds me of this.https://theintercept.com/2017/01/27/federal-reserve-bankers-mocked-unemployed-americans-behind-closed-doors/ ...

        Instead, the OS should enforce 2FAs only to defined apps/domains. This way the phishing attempt can either:
        1. trigger a browser not allowed to get credentials from 2FA to my PayPal, so no problem the website is named http://paypal.com-support.ru ,
        2. trigger a trusted browser (e.g. for Paypal), which the OS enforces can only connect to http://paypal.com  over HTTPS. So, ok.
