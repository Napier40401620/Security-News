        All kidding aside, when a flawless, upstanding candidate like Hillary loses to a Trump, the only explanation is an international spy ring.

        Our nation just took a huge step away from the rule of law, and people are seriously arguing the bright side is "no encryption backdoors".
        Leaving aside the views of whoever replaces Comey, the reason we have privacy technologies at all is because of that rule of law.
        Every app & service should be required to have a "this is how we make money" page on their website.
        There are too many "free" services that make money in shady ways. None of them are upfront about it.

        Reporter: Does the Comey firing cast a shadow over your talks?
        dat insta filterhttps://twitter.com/paleofuture/status/862330774644637696 ... 
        omg did i ever tweet about the time i went on a date with a 97 year old. its my favourite old man story
        a WIT fashion magazine called Chassis
        articles would range from "how to appear professional yet apathetic in job interviews" to "which eyeliner can also reset a server"
        seriously though WIT talk about their appearances a lot because there's so much fear of being disrespected
        we worry over interview outfits, whether to wear a dress to the office, long vs short hair, too much / not enough makeup, shoes, etc
        Dude 1 favors a "just one of the guys" look but Dude 2 likes "women to look like women" what do you do for that meeting
        how do you maintain your preferred feminine look while also broadcasting "engineer"
        WIT experience a huge push and pull between what they want to wear and how they want to be treated in the office
        and that's before we enter hard modes like "WOC with natural hair" or "you've just been invited to an offsite with a pool"
        I have been part of hours-long chats where women debated what swimsuits to wear to company funtions
        some of us bought suits specifically for that outing, tailored to the environment the best we could
        seriously WIT do so much extra mental work and gestures to maintain an even keel...and then their actual jobs on top of that
        I could seriously talk about this all day. There are different codes of dress to signal design, dev, ops, etc.
        many WIT get wild colors in their hair once they've gained a few years experience...it's like a badge
        I would not suggest a dev do wild colors before getting her first job
        the longer you're in tech, the more lax and personal your style can be...if people know you're green, it comes off wrong
        I've been considering writing a blog post on this but honestly my advice changes depending on the company / job / person / etc
        but I think about this shit a lot

        The unsaid: Both Trump & Macron represent the FIRE (finance, insurance, real estate) sector; both are the very problem they aspire to solve.
        It's only through confusion caused by excessive concerns over populism that two FIRE executives from the same class are cast as adversarial
        The same people who spent decades justifying & humanizing Big Tech now - too late! - want a tax-funded Facebook. Useful idiots still useful.
        Politics as Perpetual Re-Branding: By year's end France will have exact same political forces pursuing "apolitical" projects under new names
        Macron's "startup nation" joins failed startup nations of Obama, Renzi, Cameron - those "startups" were just buzzword-manufacturing PR firms
        Everyone talks about startups while real money/power flows via foundations/govts/monopolies. Explains Obama's $3 mil speaking gig in Milan.
        For those of you concerned about manufacturing, there is finally some good news: the future of bullshit-manufacturing looks bright.
        "Start-up talk" (and its cousin "innovation talk") is how nexus of foundations/govts/monopolies legitimizes, humanizes &extends its hegemony
        99% of those worried about "illiberal democracy" are simply too lazy to learn finance & economics and worry about "neoliberal democracy"

        Surgery is over... it seems everything went well but the hospital is chaos pure.
        Why do people still believe "responsible disclosure" has ever meant anything else than "vendor approved/friendly disclosure".
        Honestly disclosure is not much different from creating open source projects. After a while users feel so entitled that they yell at author.
        Unfortunately a lot of vendors run bug bounty programs for no other reason than that it allows them to control disclosure.

        Can we hold the high ground over FBI impersonating journalists to hack a criminal suspect if journos impersonate to simulate phishing? 
        FBI did that in public interest to catch a suspect. Journos will say their phish was in public interest too. Really not that different.
        What's the trade here? We found some victims click links, don't enter creds; and journalists may have suffered reputational damage. cool?

        My impression of Comey was that while he made some serious missteps, he was trying to be non-partisan, walking an impossible tightrope.
        For the record, if anyone should ask, I'm not applying for that job.
        We're talking to @JohnWDean about the president's firing of FBI Director James Comey. Live now on @PBS NewsHour:http://pbs.org/newshour 
        Seems significant that Trump included the recommendations of two underlings justifying the firing. May be wrong, but never seen that before.
        Can I pre-order Comey's book yet?
        The Swamp is now Officially Drained.https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/862070209959649280 ... 
        This would probably not be a bad time for folks in the WH to read up on the 37th president.
        In just our first months in office, we are accomplishing things it took Pres. Nixon until his second term to do.
        Am I right that Congress no longer has the power to appoint an independent prosecutor -- only the AG does (called special counsel)?https://twitter.com/markknoller/status/862076139845636097 ... 
        How does this work? Do two FBI agents barge in the director's office and escort him out of the building, his desk photos in a cardboard box?
        @mattblaze This seems to be how it worked. Which is, just in and of itself, insane.https://twitter.com/MLevineReports/status/862078918228140032 ... 
        Remember.pic.twitter.com/un1VhAEMe5

        We will, in fact, be greeted as liberators.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/862267781336752128 ... 
        So I wake up and check the news and the first thing I see is a picture of Henry Kissinger in the White House. Going back to bed.
        We can argue about Comey's fitness for his old job, but there's no question at this point that we need an independent special prosecutor.

        Trump's firing of the FBI director is the strongest publicly available evidence yet that Trump was backed by Russia.
