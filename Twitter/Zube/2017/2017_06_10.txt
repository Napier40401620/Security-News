        Suddenly pretty quiet over at the Twitter feed of @Messina2012, the Obama campaign manager who helped run Theresa May's campaign...
        He argues Obama's refusal to honor his own populist campaign promises helped Dems lose to Trump & lose Congress, govs & state houseshttps://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/872885192540794880 ...

        It's pretty clear elite Dems hate the "Bernie woulda won" meme because they know that, well... Bernie woulda won.
        May wins most seats, faces demands to step down. Dems lose almost everything & same people still comfortably in charge of the Dem Party.
        Theory: New version of the Nader 2000 spoilers are party elites that deliver primary wins to corporate candidates who then lose the general
        What percentage of Dem pols, operatives, donors, lobbyists & pundits would rather see a GOP presidency than, say, single payer healthcare?

        It is astonishing how many people are in jobs where they are paid significant salaries to adhering to the white dude bro code.
        It seems you can get paid for applying skills, or, given some mostly hereditary preconditions, you can get paid for loyalty & favoritism.
        The advantage of choosing (1) is that you're less dependent on others. The disadvantage is that there are glass ceilings.
        Also, it seems applying skills is much harder work than having the right preconditions and trading in loyalty & favors.

        Hypothesis: Trump stayed off Twitter as part of an audition for a lawyer, to demonstrate he can follow advice.

        no Corbyn did not win outright, but the Tories lost, badly, and the assumption that Corbynism is a sure electoral loser was also blown up
        what's more, the Tory majority is wobbly as hell -- 11 seats in Scotland they got from vote splitting, more than the DUP total
        it is, on net, a *clear* strategic victory for Corbyn and Labour, even if the particular battle was narrowly lost
        To the Brits who are entering a period where their government is held hostage by flat-earth Protestant psychopaths...you get used to it.
        also, Corbyn has faced an endless media dogpile from the day he became Labour leaderhttps://twitter.com/BenSpielberg/status/872610744319311872 ... 
        some of that was just fash tabloids, but much was milquetoast libs hammering him over electability. now he beat Milliband by 9.5 points
