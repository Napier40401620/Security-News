        Geek SlimFast gets $50 million but Signal--which protects our privacy--can't raise $10 million to pay for for SMS activation of new users.https://twitter.com/mims/status/860198744104501248 ... 
        Signal could raise the money if it surrendered to VC rules--which would almost certainly require a "business model" because it's not Juicero.
        Signal needs to be funded as it is. VCs are so used to burning money; they should just throw this money at Signal and pretend it's a juicer.
        Hey, Silicon Valley VCs! See my deck Signal's business model!

        I think tech talks are good for speakers because they're like public resumes. And they're a good way to advertise a certain technology.
        But usually a tech talk informs me something exists, so I can read the docs / blog posts later.
        Of course if the docs are shit I won't use it anyway, but that's a cultural subject so never mind just a waste of time
        Tech talks are useful but culture talks are impactful. You need both.
        Anyone who says that their ability to hear you hinges on you speaking in a way they approve of was never going to listen to you, anyway.

        being offended by literally everything is such a WORKOUT my abs look amazing
        waiting on my honorary MBA for managing men's feelings
        Been thinking about it, and there's two types of tech talks I like:
        but so often we get "how this product works" or, if we're lucky, "how product x works with product y"
        which could literally be a 5 minute pitch that links to a blog post
        culture talks are appealing because they apply to a variety of jobs and settings...they're not vendor-specific
        and the tech talks I find successful do the same
        but that's a lot harder to do than a sales demo

        And people think socialism is a bad idea.
        There really is such a thing as class warfare. But it's always the rich making war against the poor.

        Sure, they'll pay for this in 2018, assuming we survive that long.
        For those lucky enough to have jobs w good insurance, "pre-existing conditions" essentially made you an indentured servant of your employer.
        I know several people who weren't well served by Obamacare. But the problems it fixed were incredibly important - literally life-and-death.
        "Lifetime caps" used to be routine provisions of even good policies. A single, relatively minor, health crisis could quickly exceed them.
        So go ahead and crow about "victory for personal freedom" or whatever nonsense helps you sleep at night, but people died because of this.
        Obamacare made the entire premise of Breaking Bad obsolete. I guess now we should all brush up on our chemistry skills in case we get sick.
        Protip: now might be a good time to delete that tweet bragging about not voting because it makes no difference who wins.
        Will Trumpcare cover Comey's nausea?
        I guess if you're repelled by the possibility of contributing to someone else's healthcare, it makes sense to hate Obamacare. And insurance.
