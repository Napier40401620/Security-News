        rr is about 5 person-years of work, not a huge project. For the last year it's been totally volunteer work.

        1/ The holy grail for election tampering is county election office networks, 122 of which were targeted here (with unknown success).
        2/ If successful, this potentially gives access to
        3/3 There are ~3000 counties in the US, each with different network configuration & security practices. Attacker mileage will vary.
        Worst possible outcome: we again fail to secure voting systems because of partisan interest in  maintaining myth current systems are secure.
        Yes, the winner of the last election (regardless of party) wants to be able to say voting systems are secure. But they aren't. We must fix.
        Fun fact: the hardest part of the voting system security studies I ran was finding time to write down all the vulnerabilities we found.
        Whether or not Russia tampered with 2016 election, securing our voting infrastructure needs to become an urgent national priority.
        Less interested in assigning blame for outing Winner (a complex situation) than in discussion of protecting such sources in future.
        But I'm even more interested in the substance of the leak, which seems to be the tip of a very interesting iceberg.
        Useful heuristic: when someone says "maybe the blockchain will solve this" they probably understand neither the problem nor the blockchain.

        A question I hear far too often, "how do I block PowerShell?" Why do I never hear, "how do I block untrusted executables?"
        Have you really looked at waitfor.exe?   This is one interesting built in binary https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731613(v=ws.11).aspx ...
