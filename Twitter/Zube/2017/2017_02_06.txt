        The protection itself is awe-inspiring. It starts the drive head moving by toggling the appropriate soft switch FROM INTERPRETED BYTECODE...
        ...then calls a native routine to read data while the drive head is still moving across 4 identical, perfectly synchronized quarter tracks.

        In most crypto interfaces, if you pass the equivalent of Block.Encrypt 10 blocks, it will encrypt all 10. Sounds great. But: that's ECB!
        Go's interface has instead carefully segregated the block transform so that if you want ECB, you have to code ECB yourself.
        In most cases, what you really want is an instance of crypto/cipher.AEAD. Does what @dakami wants.
        I'd be happier if crypto/cipher.Block got moved to crypto/unsafe. But: marginal win. crypto/aes.NewCipher still returns a Block, not AEAD.
        I'd be happier still if they moved crypto/aes to crypto/unsafe/a-e-s. I wrote a blog post to that effect a long time ago.
        Long story short: use Signal. Use Tor. Use crypto/cipher.AEAD.
