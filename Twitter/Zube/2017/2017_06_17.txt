        In the field of computer security, you can be bad at defense and not know it.  You can't be bad at offense without knowing about it.

        Don't fall for "we need a seat at the table" excuses. We've had six months of Trump co-opting advisers; we don't need to get played again

        *checking out at Whole Foods*
        Wow @amazon.pic.twitter.com/tsTf2jPUDE
        Does anyone know of studies/simulations of how society would look once 50% of people get all their groceries/purchases from Amazon? @fmanjoo
        I'm at a point where a majority of all purchases I make are at Amazon. I'm not sure how this would scale to 150 million people.
        I'm thinking we're going to start moving to very large electronic parcel locker systems for apartments, robotic door delivery for suburbs?
        How are we going to buy food at Amazon Go when nobody has a job
        Customers look on as a scruffy man walks into Amazon Foods and starts putting food in a bag. The shelves turn red - "Error, please identify"
        He bolts for the door, running into the street, with no employees to stop him. "Please identify." Jacob starts running, putting up his hood.
        Amazon Customer Care drones launch from the roof, filling the sector for a mile with grid of aerial surveillance. They quickly spot Jacob.
        Two Heavy Lift drones launch, 2-foot blades screaming into the northwest, towards the interloper. LRAD payloads fills his ears with sirens.
        Jacob darts to buildings on the street, trying to escape his pursuers indoors, but Amazon Security locks every door he tries through Alexa.
        Heavy Lift Drone M148B2919S01 fires a 12-gauge electrostimulant dart into Jacob's back. He crumples to the street, head hitting the sidewalk
        The ground is cold. It's night, as Jacob wakes up from a terrible dream, rubbing his wrists, opening his eyes on a red-painted curb.
        An Amazon Patrol glides to a stop. "Do you require assistance..." Jacob's wrists flash green, "Amazon Customer Jacob Harris."

        "Complexity is enemy of Security"...
        Obviously that doesn't mean that complexity _adds_ security. Only that general oversimplifications in infosec are often worthless.
        Directly inspired by thread:https://twitter.com/halvarflake/status/875362646882746369 ... 
        I could go on with the list almost to no end. E.g.:
        Just like there are no simple truths about what makes things beautiful, likewise there are no simple "laws" which'd assure security. #IMHO
        related, my fave is "security by obscurity isn't security". sure it is. the problem is obscurity doesn't *scale*
        my usual retort to people who disagree is "ok, try and separate obscurity and entropy. i'll wait"
