        On the bright side, ransomware attacks are going to encourage people to back up their files.  I'm an eternal optimist!

        Based on the rapid spread of "WannaCry" ransomware, we decided to raise the #Infocon threat level to YELLOW https://isc.sans.edu  .
        When I used my re-search.py tool to extract BTC addresses from the latest WCry samples, I found a small bug. Bugfix:https://blog.didierstevens.com/2017/05/13/update-re_search-py-version-0-0-5/ ... 
        Just had a discussion with @DidierStevens - it looks as the #WannaCry sinkhole will not help companies that require use of proxies :(

        "Turn off services and features you aren't using" is at least as important as "patch early and often".
        There are a lot of things orgs could have done to prevent the latest ransomware. Trick is to learn from this w/o blaming victims.

        Security resume idea: email your resume as a .doc thats empty except for "don't open word documents what r u doing"

        Please stop victim blaming. Saying "Patch your shit" to hospitals tied to dozens of insecure vendors shows your ignorance. #WannaCry
        It's the same as saying "apply principle of least priv to your 50,000 employees". Sounds great, but basically impossible.
        Let's not forget that every device, desktop, gadget, widget and application has a bunch of baggage. Hospitals need stuff that "works now".
        And yes, unfortunately that means systems that "do the job" but might be vuln to stuff. We should be helping, not saying "told ya so!".
        We should be hitting the problem at the source, not targeting the consumers. Doctors, nurses, etc have enough shit to worry about.
        So let's do something more constructive, like coming up with ways for these people to move into a more secure space.

        Is it efficient? Nope, is it cost-effective? Installing full operating systems on, effectively, a smart screen? Do you need a print spooler... 
        on every machine? Or the capability of handling the weirdest USB devices? Really? Come on, let's admit that we want cheap, we cannot... 
        be bothered to design anything because "everyone does it this way". The "PC revolution" is one of the stupidest designs in mankind, you... 
        have PC architectures pretending to be servers to PCs pretending to be smart screens. All carrying years and years of baggage. But "cheap".
        So, some idiot sold the world that having Solitaire-capable PCs on every nurse's and doctor's desk was a good idea. Well done, proud of you... 
        in the meantime this is the PC industry that, back in the 90s, fought be because someone had the smart idea of moving licenses with timezone
        and saved money by using in Europe the Asian & US licenses while they were asleep. Killed. Why? Because this is about money, not your... 
        security or your efficiency. If they wanted you efficient they would design an OS which barely boots with 8Gb of RAM and a wordprocessor... 
        sluggish on a 4-core processor? What exactly does it do which WordPerfect on Windows 3.11 didn't do (except require a Cray-1 equivalent?)
        Of course now you'll say "the cloud"...  right, it was called distributed computing and was a better design. Your browser is your OS, better... 
        but the browser is not a thin client and still "thinks too much". Also, the servers run what? Azure? Oh, I feel safe now... 
        but there's Google docs, from a company living on advertising and selling you because you are unwilling to pay for their services! How ... 
        ridiculous is this? A company has to, effectively, sell their clients for a useful, more secure service, because clients demand that safe... 
        design is free. A company is motivated by cheapskates to sell your privacy. Not bad what the "PC revolution" bought us. Not bad.
        Note that we *do* know how to build secure and reliable systems. Examples are everywhere but nobody wants to pay for them to go mainstream.

        So, has #WannaCry pissed off someone important enough to want a serious solution to the issue? Not yet? Just usual political banter?

        So, rather than a zillion hapless small biz/individuals quietly paying up, we have splashy "NSA Tools Attacking Hospitals" headlines.
        What's the main lesson of the ETERNALBLUE-based malware? I have no idea. There seem to a whole bunch of lessons here, and open questions.
        Anyway, I'm sure whatever the main lesson is, it's that you should have listened to something I've been saying all along.
        Security advice telling people "just patch it" is unfairly blaming customers. There are good reasons they don't -- https://theconversation.com/online-security-wont-improve-until-companies-stop-passing-the-buck-to-the-customer-75274 ... pic.twitter.com/dt4HFtFX9w
        Before you glibly blame the victims of the latest ransomware for not patching, read this by @SteveBellovin https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/blog/2017-05/2017-05-12.html ... 
        Looks like the "Deep Throat" garage in Arlington is still there, in case anyone needs a quiet spot for leaking.http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/03/13/monday-properties-asks-for-more-time-to-redevelop.html ... 
        Of course, today, "Deep Throat" would have to worry about security cameras, cell phone tracking, license plate reader records, etc.
        Whoo hooo! Congratulations!!! Somebody better hire Dr. @sa3nder fast - awesome, bright, talented! Go go go!https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/863099491141996544 ... 
        Epic subtweet.https://twitter.com/GermanyinUSA/status/863130108944670720 ... 
        Look, if the President's own lawyers say he's not guilty, what more do you people want?
        News of measles outbreak didn't reach TX: Texas House passes bill banning MDs from vaccinating new foster children  http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/5/11/1661385/-Texas-House-passes-bill-banning-doctors-from-vaccinating-new-foster-children ... pic.twitter.com/gn9ZpoHrTP
        I wonder what fraction of the systems affected by the ransomware weren't actually using the SMB service that infected it.
        "Turn off services and features you aren't using" is at least as important as "patch early and often".
        Follow @MerriamWebster for the sly political subtweets, stay for the nerd words.https://twitter.com/MerriamWebster/status/862993164801540096 ... 
        There are a lot of things orgs could have done to prevent the latest ransomware. Trick is to learn from this w/o blaming victims.
        One thing I agree with the President about: the cyber really is very hard.
        The interesting part here isn't what to *do* - we know most of that already. It's how, exactly, to prioritize these things in practice.
        Today has been a lesson in "security is hard". Complex, interconnected systems operating in complex economic conditions make for bad times.
        Bottom line: "your system administrator is incompetent for not patching" is not a helpful observation at scale.

        Update: my mistake, that isn't the domain. That one's registered since 1999.
        The domain that stopped the #WannaCry malware was '... http://iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com ', here's its DNS report;https://dnsspy.io/scan/iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com ... 
        IPv6-only infections can't reach the domain and would likely keep spreading. But how many hosts are actually IPv6 *only*?

        While security updates require reboots, security updates will not be applied. This is utterly inevitable and the industry's job to solve.
        Automatically slightly discounting takes from people premised on DAG Rosenstein being a Trump stooge.
        Current take, not strongly held: Comey firing was more than anything a giant, emotional, overreacting miscalculation by Trump.

        It could have been much quicker but with QA testing, AV evasion, Tor integration, multi lang GUI... it's not that bad. That's a lot of work
