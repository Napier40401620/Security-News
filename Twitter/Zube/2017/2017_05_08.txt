        Would feel so sad if I worked for a high powered govt hacking agency and all I did was phishing attacks.  I'd dream of doing sqli attacks.

        do I cool it with my night studies, get some hobbies, move to a slower promotion track, and still be around when I'm 50?
        or do I keep this up, push myself more, and reach for a summit that someone will try to shove me off of in a few years?
        I need to find some balance if I'm going to hit the 10 year mark

        is there a particular thing that "late capitalism" means or is it really just "i do not like this"?
        is it late capitalism when i notice an airport doesn'r have free wifi and i immediately think "fucking scumbags"
        i sat down at a restaurant and my knee hit the table and it hurt a bunch. late stage capitalism
        "late stage capitalism!" is millennials' answer to "millennals are lazy!"
        I love to react online to the unfolding horrors of late capitalism and our dying planet. "Not good," I post.
        whenever i get a new conservative follower i start checking obsessively to see which tweet makes them unfollow me
        (starts putting phone in pocket) ah, who am i kidding?

        And this is the reason why, with AV companies, I tend to refuse collaborating in what vendors call "responsible disclosure".
        Why reporting vulnerabilities to AV vendors, "responsibly", doesn't make you any safer: BitDefender, 155 days.
        Dear Twitterverse, I am looking for a command line tool that takes PE and/or ELF files as input and dumps CFGs of disassemblies. FOSS.
        Is there anything? I tried radare2, but it's been crunching for 4 hours on a non-malicious test DLL, and I need something reliable...
        This is basically the same: http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/upcoming/ ... 
        What grinds my gears (see Intel ME): (1) Trivial bugs in (2) overprivileged code. I can deal with subtle bugs in necessary attack surface.
        To be precise about my previous CFG tweet: I'd like the tool to finish in less than many hours on reasonably large files.

        Can someone explain in 3 twitter responses or less why it's a problem that @Tavis announces on Twitter he's found a cool bug? Any takers?
        I keep hearing intelligent people implying that @taviso saying he found a vuln in X causes harm. What am I missing?
        If we keep this ridiculous thing going, there won't be independent research for the public's interest, and it will hurt everyone.
        For the ladies reading this, he's now sending me emails asking if he can use my product bc he needs it for his code to be performant enough

        Mitigations and their effects on exploitation by @mdowd

        [..]a public announcement that a bug was reported on day X has a way better psychological effect & stays around for as long disclosure takes
        Got nothing better to do than bashing @taviso? Like, fixing your sh*t?

        Still see no articles about the south korean presidental election ballot paper controversy in english media.
        I think @taviso is cool
        even before he was cool!
        it seems working for certain corporations just corrupts people
        Every coordinated vulnerability disclosure should start with a public announcement that bug was reported to vendor X on day Y.
        If all disclosure would start with an announcement that a bug was reported to vendor X on day Y people would understand that 0-day is normal
