SwiftOnSecurity

        Because there was no indication Microsoft patched these bugs, researcher systems did not include last month's patches, so they still worked.
        Excluding generational improvements in security like Windows 10, vulnerabilities are rarely fixed by being rediscovered by someone else.
        So it was, in the heat of the moment, fairly logical to assume there was no point installing last months updates on research test machines.
        This is good news for home users. HOWEVER. This is still incredibly dangerous, and institutional security people are right to be scared:
        A similar bug to this was released in 2008, and for the last 9 years companies have been still trying to assure all systems are patched.
        This is a one-button hack. You press the button and you own the server. Full code execution. Anything you want. It's super bad. Crazy bad.
        Further, many companies are still using Server 2003. It's a bad idea, but they could weigh risks.
        Also Windows XP will never be patched. If anyone plugs into any network with Server 2003 or Windows XP, they can instantly take them over.
        rem you bypass fw via malspam. once in, the SMB RCE can be used for a blitzkrieg-type automated lateral movement if SMB is enabled
        So this is still REALLY BAD. You don't understand how bad unless you're in enterprise IT. The vulnerability will last ten years or more.
        I am thinking that all of this could explain the real reason Feb. patching was delayed.
        It's well-known that Microsoft runs an incredibly tight ship on handling critical vulnerabilities, so not surprising this news didn't leak.
        But everything is really bad if you're running ancient software from 15 years ago.
        Hell I'm friends with some of the people who handle this stuff and they didn't tell me anything. But it was right that they didn't.
        In whirling confluence of events, unfortunately this is reporting that was incorrect, but has good explanations and was quickly corrected.
        For initial triage, an unpatched machine allows quick verification & IOC/signature generation but due diligence requires additional tests.

        So the truth now is: not really any 0day in ShadowBrokers windows dump. All fixed by MSFT before.

        I thought NSA exploit toolkit would be cooler, new #ShadowBrokers leak makes me sad, I guess I saw too many hackers movies #NSAoldschool
        No Oracle 0days in #ShadowBrokers leak, SWIFT seems to use Oracle, there was a bunch of Oracle 0days few years ago, why just leak MS 0days?
        lol
        This is definitely the most relevant dump from #ShadowBrokers - Hacking SWIFT is BIG DEAL. Here is why:https://medium.com/@msuiche/the-nsa-compromised-swift-network-50ec3000b195 ... 
        Why so much fear about #ShadowBrokers 0days leaked? if you already are in internal network, game over, no need 0days, just patience
        So #cyberapocalypse starts in 3,2,1.. or not?
        Cool stuff from @tiraniddohttps://twitter.com/hitbmedia/status/852861388234031105 ... 
        Funny some people say why NSA didn't tell MS about the 0days, since when NSA does responsible disclosure?
        If you are worried about #ShadowBrokers 0days it probably means you have to worry a lot more about your current infrastructure
        Weird world, I haven't heard anyone complaining about MS vulnerable software, without vulnerabilities there aren't 0days
        Also those 0days could have been used to save some lives, then you should thank MS and NSA too, like I said, weird world
        So there is no #cyberapocalypse and in the end #ShadowBrokers are making big contributions to global cyber security, you may wonder why?
        Well, looks like the real number is: 0. https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/853034220016586754 ...

        Just realised the exploit for CVE-2017-0197 (Office 2010) fits exactly in one tweet  /cc @yorickkosterhttps://twitter.com/buffaloverflow/status/852936732106424320 ... 
        #ShadowBrokers ESKIMOROLL (Eskimoroll-1.1.1.exe) is MS14-068 exploit with MD5 "signature"
        That was fast. I gotta go bribe Mudge for that license... ugh :(
        Weird, considering that MSFT patched the bugs last month and didn't credit anyone. Very carefully worded statements too. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯https://twitter.com/samfbiddle/status/853025550096621568 ... 
        I am thinking that all of this could explain the real reason Feb. patching was delayed.

        Has anyone ran SMB exploits with v1 turned off yet? Any wireshark pcaps post exploitation. Post here if so
        You definitely want to disable SMBv1 in your organisation. Also, so far 3 of the exploits work, zero day, unauth remote RCE.
        Disable SMBv1.

        The silence from @msftsecurity is deafening. This is being handled very poorly.
        Infosec metric: the more your security org freaks out when 0-days drop, the less mature it is. Mature orgs treat 0-days as expected, normal.
