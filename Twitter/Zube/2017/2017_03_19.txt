+         Fascinating how many men read my thread about being approached in public
+  and got upset at me.
+         I didn't say don't say hi at all, just where and when to do so. I gave s
+ pecific examples. They ignore that and tell me I'm rude.
+         You know what it is? I ruined a fantasy for them. However vague it was.
+         Some men follow me on Twitter and think they know me and that they can c
+ ome up any time. That's not true. Not they're mad.
+         I expect even more men to respond to this thread and tell me what a stuc
+ k bitch I am :v but the women understand.
