        I'm losing out on so much cash I should monetize this account and sell branded vaporizers
        I have this headset, best bit about it is it's relatively balanced audio, so it's very usable as a headset for everything, not just gaming.
        It was originally a pro audio headset rebranded with a good mic, so by lineage it's not a gaming headset. look it up.

        True, traveling musicans live or die by an intricate and reliable logistics system and can spot when it's falling apart. I would know.
        Fun fact: Major reason musical artists like doing residency acts in Vegas is because they don't have to build and tear down each night.

        "All criticism of Obama's paid speeches is just racism" seems to conflict with all the similar criticism of Clinton's paid speeches

        The playbook:
        The Dark Overlord has probably one of the best understandings of the media from hackers. Know to ask first to chat off the record, etc

        A reminder: provable security is only as good as the definitions. It's easy to miss classes of attacks in definitions. Security audits help.

        This is one of primary arch-level differentiators of Qubes vs. other VM-based solutions, e.g. Bromium, (now-defunct) Capsule, etc.

        I can't help but notice the subtle difference between titles of academic papers for peer review & talk titles for hacker cons... 
        Oh, and academic papers related to OAuth2 & Blockchain.... Not the easiest thing to read on a saturday early afternoon.
        Fascinating to see @tdohack3r attempting a business model (blackmail) against content owners that afaik has never worked. Idiots.
