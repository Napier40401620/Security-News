        Our astonishing ability to read repurposes an evolutionary older brain area - discarding one of its major skills.

        McCain has long been the liberals' fave reactionary, save for '08 when he was Hitler to Palin's Eva Braun. Trump restored that liberal love.
        In the late-90s, I appeared on Alan Colmes' radio show in NYC with two Clinton libs who berated me for criticizing McCain's role in Vietnam.
        One of them was Drew Barrymore's mother (then a regular on Howard Stern) who defended McCain's bombing raids as heroic.
        Colmes also called McCain a "war hero." This was when Colmes was a Fox News liberal. I asked him if he did the gig strictly for money.
        Colmes hemmed and hawed, then got testy when I called him Sean Hannity's punching bag. Can't remember if I was ever invited back.

        Ah, Twitter doesn't notify you of logins from known devices. However, changing password does not invalidate those cookies (but logs you out)

        Common mistake by most of the people: There is no 'good state - bad state'. There are normal people in Iran or China too! Just like us!
        Chinese or Iranian people are not aliens.. they are humans just like us. There is no 'threat' from China or Iran.
        There is a threat in the diplomatic relations between China and for example the USA. Its the leaders of the states who would run a war.
        Just want to mention this. It's easy to forget thinking about the other side when you only talk about "China" or "Iran".
        You should talk about the "The Chinese people" instead.
        I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.

        The news should start talking about persons instead of states when "North Korea tests a nuclear bomb" its Kim Jong Un who lets it test.

        So-called 9th Circuit will have a "decision" in immigration stay. The only possible correct ruling is if they order the plaintiffs executed.
        9th Circuit is a bunch of doo-doo heads.

        Trump's acknowledgement of "One China" policy today is why you don't say stuff until you have a really good idea why you're saying stuff.
        Maybe because Jared Kushner is chasing Chinese money? https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/us/politics/jared-kushner-trump-business.html?_r=0 ... https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/830036200941559808 ... 
        "if China can bring about a change like this, it may succeed in softening other U.S. positions"... Is Trump reversing his trade pledges?
        I don't say this often enough. Justin Trudeau is awful and an obvious con artist.
        He's twelve days late now on NAFTA. Is that because Commerce/USTR officials aren't confirmed or something else?https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/827207804469538816 ...

        The sincerity of DT's promises to workers  will likely be judged on whether Bayer/Monsanto, ATT/Time Warner, Sprint/whomever are approved.

        1. Full disk encryption is good, and should be enabled, but is nothing close to "encrypt everything". Provides very little safety, in fact.
        2. 2FA defaults for most services are inadequate vs. state-level attackers, the mail's implied threat model.
        3. Running your own email server instead of using Google will simply get your mail server owned.
        4. No channel is less safe than email. Don't rely on "PKI encryption" for email, or PGP. Never use S/MIME.
        5. Journalists wanting VPNs are going to use terrifying 3rd party VPNs, or things like Streisand. Don't.
        Most important advice I can offer to journalists protecting themselves from hackers:
