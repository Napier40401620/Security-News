        Humanity now keeps aloft a million of its people worldwide, moving at hundreds of miles an hour, safer than them traveling on the ground.
        
        Every time I watch or read about aviation, I learn about new safety controls, ones that never once _occurred_ to me at all as a layperson
        
        Did you know they patrol runways daily for debris as small as a nut - while the runways are in use, between landings? Never occurred to me.

        So BART is wider for better stability to cross the Golden Gate.

        Recent Montana election notwithstanding, I'm skeptical of calls to end early voting. Making voting easy and accessible is important.
        "Candidate suddenly reveals self to be monster on eve of election day" (obviously) can happen, but I'm not sure it's worth designing around.
        Why was Gianforte charged only w/ misdemeanor assault? Sounds like "reasonable apprehension of serious injury" per http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/45/5/45-5-202.htm ... 
        Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, but I'm apprehensive about serious bodily injury, which I think qualifies me as an expert.
        Anyway, I'm definitely packing an extra pair of glasses should I find myself heading to Montana for any reason.
        Is there a worse place than Twitter to pose a rhetorical question?

        This lot in downtown Oakland has been empty for around 50 yearspic.twitter.com/WUOGi91yDK
        Oakland demolished 12 blocks of downtown in order to build a giant mall aimed at out of towners in the hope of improving sales tax revenue
        These blocks were mixed commercial/residential. Much of Oakland's downtown business district was destroyed. Thousands were displaced.
        The money to build the mall was never raised. Most of the land was empty until the 90s, two blocks still are.
        The adjacent blocks that were spared are now the heart of Historic Downtown Oakland, a thriving shopping and entertainment district.
        A city ruined because its rulers cared more about rich white non-residents than their actual citizens. Fucksake.

        On the trail last year I heard repeatedly that people were grossed out by both parties. They need reasons to vote beyond disgust.https://twitter.com/barbarabcurry/status/868181931711713280 ...

        Sure it does, but I think this is another misconception- that if Republicans just knew how wrong they were, they would vote Democratic.https://twitter.com/jimatsunburst/status/868184375048810496 ...
