        Word to the wise about the Echo Look camera--don't let it see your Google Home

        "there's one physical button on the side of the Echo Look that electronically disconnects the camera and mics." This need to be mechanical

        1AM thought thread: Institutional crisis communications, and why they are so bad.
        Institutions are regularly exceptionally bad at crisis communications, and it fascinates me. Why is this, exactly? How do they fail?
        1.) Slow to recognize crisis
        Is this because
        So many people need to authorize response, so many lawyers recommending non-answers to avoid legal responsibility.
        So so so many awful institutional failures don't go viral that on balance, ignoring/obfuscation ends up paying off, although decreasingly.
        Plus, outdated pr management strategy dictated that the convo was driven by reporters. Reporters can be soothed w/ bs. Internet, less so.
        I see this in politics all the time. Older operatives want to send nothing statements to local press & have off-rec convo to smooth crisis.
        I have, since my teenage years, wanted to write a blog named "What They Should Have Said," where I re-write public statements. I'm weird.

        By the way, disabling Wi-Fi in the UI doesn't turn off the chip; it can still DMA into the host at that state.
        You can also use the PCIe DMA to privesc from Android processes that have access to the Wi-Fi chip into EL2 or the kernel. Unmitigated.
        Just to make it clear: the Wi-Fi SoC can also DMA onto the hypervisor (e.g., RKP), so this is a privesc into EL2 as well.
