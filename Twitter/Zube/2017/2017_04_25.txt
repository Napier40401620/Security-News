        Dug up this historic example from glibc of why optimizing compilers are a necessary mitigation against hideous code: https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=string/strstr.c;hb=0ecb606cb6cf65de1d9fc8a919bceb4be476c602 ...

        My point isn't to poke fun at the code, but that this kind of coding is the necessary evolutionary endgame with non-optimizing compilers.
        You end up stuck in local extrema ("fast" ver of quadratic algo) b/c nobody's qualified to rewrite the linear-time one in "high-level asm".
        And you end up with code that's impossible to debug/verify/audit because it's not even obvious what it's doing.
        One important caveat: if you think passphrase may be compromised, you must delete pubkey from trust. Changing passphrase doesn't help.

        Trump understands how to play the domestic game at some level. He's a national showman. But the world stage? This requires his peers' advice

        After their losses, did Dukakis or Gore have as many Dem partisans as Clinton insisting they were blameless & ran amazing campaigns?
        Post-loss defense of Clinton by Dem operatives/consultants makes sense if you see it as them defending their own continued career viability.

        So if I understand correctly the story about Uber "tracking" iPhones is just about Uber remembering a device was used before for Uber.
        So this means the uproar about Uber violating privacy is the usual nonsense from people who do not understand what they talk/write about.
        I am not really surprised Uber had geofencing against Apple in their App. They make rule violations up while they go so best block them.
        Now that 1st round of French election ia over certain entities will likely drop Macron's mailspool soon, or not?
        I am always annoyed that I am forced to connect my iPhone to wifi from time to time because otherwise Apps become unusable [...]
        [...] because someone decided certain Apps can only be downloaded via WiFi. And old app becomes unusable at this point.
        Example:there is a 200mb Facebook update right now. Refuses to download via LTE. But availibility of download blocks currently installed one
        Oh haha. Apprently iOS still has the bug that those enforced download limits can be circumvented by rebooting the device.
        After triggering a user tracking shitstorm the @nytimes apparently silently corrected their @uber story.
