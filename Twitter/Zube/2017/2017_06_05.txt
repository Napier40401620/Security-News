+         Car hacking makes great headlines but remember no one has ever had their
+  car hacked by a bad guy.Its only ever been performed by researchers
+         The bad news is cars have become moving computer networks vulnerable to
+ attack.
+         The good news is we've spent years figuring out how to secure computer n
+ etworks and many of the same techniques apply.
+         Car makers seem to be taking the threat of cyber attack more seriously,
+ but I'd still like to see more transparency from them.
+         Driverless car sec is hard because you need to worry about the new senso
+ rs/computers as well as the inherent vulns in the base car itself.
+         Despite the difficulties of securing autonomous vehicles, I believe it i
+ s ultimately a solvable problem.
+         If I didn't believe that, I'd get a different job.

+         At one point, Avos was spending $40K/month on AWS hosting, and their tot
+ al *lifetime* revenue was $7K. I wish I'd made fun of them harder
+         Sorry, I mean lifetime revenue from premium accounts. Of course they mad
+ e about $5k/month from ads
+         Right now Delicious has 58K active users (vs. 29K for Pinboard), and the
+ y save 1.5 M bookmarks/month (vs 2.2 M for Pinboard)
+         Definitely just got a @Pinboard account entirely because dude bought Del
+ icous and then bragged about it.
+         I'm planning to delete the piles of spam tweets. It's just like working
+ on Delicious in the 2000s again - I did a ton of spamfighting.
+         All we need to make Delicious nostalgia complete now that the former com

+         Thought #1: This is not a Jr Developer mistake. Any developer, including

+ safely contribute, you're an unserious dev team. Most are.
+         Unserious teams console themselves by noting that all their peers have s
+ ame problem. Yes, they do. All their peers are fucked and unserious.
