        Hey #k8s #kubernetes community you're about to lose @jessfraz because the maintainers think abuse is ok
        They think if the abuse didn't happen on their project then it doesn't matter.
        They are doing what the tech community always does: ignoring women. Allowing abusers to thrive. Claiming no responsibility.
        If you don't want to be a part of that, let them know. Tell them what you think about abusers in tech.
        This is how tech loses women. And you're watching it happen in real time. What will you do?

        I've been contacted by a #kubernetes maintainer. They are looking into this issue right now. Thanks for your support.
        Boosting because Twitter algorithms are weird. The maintainers are looking into things.

        what angers me about this is, engineers just want shit done, properly of course, but 'hackers' take a demeaning attitude towards them.
        also, these pen-testers don't understand trade offs, y'know maybe sometimes risk is acceptable?

        Back in 1998/99 I remember discussing hacking the SWIFT network with my students in SANS Track 4, purely hypothetically, until I discovered... 
        I had a SWIFT engineer in the audience. The discussion, while remaining hypothetical, became terribly serious. What had started as a boutade
        with me asking "why should you waste good hacks on a PC when the SWIFT network is where the money is?" became a discussion on methodologies... 
        You can date it because I was all about network attacks: we take over this Cisco, MITM their telnet remote management, grab control of the... 
        terminal w/ remotely sent credentials, etc. Of course the best "solution" came in the form of the Neapolitan Scam: i.e. set up a fake bank... 
        in a suitable location and just abuse the SWIFT network directly from a valid connection but, again, network attacks.
        Fundamentally: I miss teaching. A lot. If you love teaching students give you back so much.
        The next Falcon 9 1st stage had better do a happy dance on landing as it is too easy now.

        Work on your own project jackass. Stop coming to mine.
        It is unbelievably abusive to talk shit about a project publicly, then start taking credit for fixing it without even doing anything
        But hey we all knew you'd take credit for it anyways because you're a fucking narcissist
        Was it so fucking hard for you dude to let me have something without you shitting all over it? How is this so fucking hard?
        I took 2 Xanax 2 hours ago and it's be great if those could kick in now
        Your code of conducts are bullshit if they do not cover things that happened outside the project.
        Why the fuck am I still dealing with this bullshit.
        I can already see where this is going so if you are hiring, email jess at linux dot com
        How many jobs do I have to leave because of THE SAME FUCKING ASSHOLE
        Just leave me the fuck alone dude. I don't want to play your stupid game.

        You're likely not making unauthorized access to a device by downloading a public torrent. Verification of stolen data is important

        https://semiaccurate.com/2017/05/01/remote-security-exploit-2008-intel-platforms/ ...  is a claim that Intel's AMT is remotely exploitable in all Nehalam and later platforms. I'm sceptical.
        It's not conceptually implausible, but the technical details in the article are bad (how would the ME bypass disk encryption before unlock?)
        It's also possible that there *is* a patched vulnerability of some sort and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the article's claims
        In any case: it's unlikely that SemiAccurate couldn't find a single security professional who'd take them seriously if they had something
        Any number of people who'd be only too happy to be part of publishing research into a giant Intel fuckup
        "We only care about someone's behaviour within our project" is almost as bad as "We only care about the code"
        Even if they *don't* misbehave within your project, their behaviour elsewhere still has an impact on your other project members
        Saying that behaviour is important but only within your community is a marketing exercise - you're saying "This is a well-behaved community"
        If you genuinely care about building a safe, welcoming community, you need to take external behaviour into account as well
