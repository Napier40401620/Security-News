        Tbh the bulldog is a perfect example of the brexit mentality. The ability to choke yourself to death with your own face.

        So, the law passed. For VPNs recs: the three I heard most about were: @getcloak @theTunnelBear (PAID) and @FreedomeVPN. Don't use free ones.
        Unfortunately, none of them are audited. Many VPNs are scams--a huge privacy risk. Making recs based on best available but incomplete info.
        To recap: Don't use free VPNs. Don't ask Google--some top results are scams. Their business model is to scam you or obliterate your privacy.

        So I'm not really good at being mean so this kinda backfired as a concept but whatever, deal with my random tidbits of shiz
        I _can_ be mean when the people deserve it, but obviously contributors to a project don't... BDFLs tho.... jk jk

        Heaven forbid you ever make an April Fool's joke about something you are an expert on... the internet will still try to mansplain you
        I don't thin you all realize how much thought I put into jokes so that a bunch of dudes WON'T bombard my mentions and explain shit to me
        For that one specifically I thought I have to put "APRIL FOOLS" in it or people won't realize it a joke, I try to make it easy for you...
        But nooooooooo
        I have these mini retrospectives in my head like you did: x, y, & z
