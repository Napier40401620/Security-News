        I wrote one Muslim joke for Bill Maher. When Mike Tyson was released from prison, he said that he converted to Islam.
        I wrote that upon Tyson's release, he'd either fight Riddick Bowe or kill Salman Rushdie. It got a nice laugh, the correct one, as I recall.

        To avoid any confusion: I did *not* break SHA1 nor played any role in the cryptographic part of the new SHA1 collision...
        I crafted the collision prefix to guarantee that no matter what the collision blocks would be, we could obtain 2 valid (PDF) files...

        As you'd expect, a polyglot collision is possible but then Adobe Reader compatibility would be lost as usual.

        Main implications of this collision: some people lost a bet and owe their friends a drink.
        We have broken SHA-1 in practice.
        Also, if you really *have* to use SHA-1, use h(h(m)). You're unlikely to have to buy another drink to your friends with that one.

        Americans hate Trump (38% approve, 55% disapprove), but they hate Dems more (32% approve, 59% disapprove).http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-disapproval-rating-235270 ... 
        GOP are most unpopular (31/62), Dems next most unpopular (32/59), Trump next most unpopular (38/55).
        So the negative campaigns have already all worked. The strategy for the Democrats to beat Trump has to be organized around restoring trust.
        Voters approve 47-41 of Trump's handling of the economy. On all other issues voters disapprove One recession and he's done. And a boom?
        Democrats give a 59% approval rating and a 31% disapproval rating to Congressional Democrats. That's bad for incumbents, good for primaries.
        Then again it's probably Putin and Comey that have made Congressional Democrats less popular than Trump in a Quinnipiac poll.
        ObamaCare will be replaced with something that actually works--bringing freedom and individual responsibility back to American health care.
        @VP My buddy Matt would be 31 today if he didn't lack the freedom and individual responsibility to deal with his own Leukemia. His fault!

        A lot of our inborn biases are heuristics that work most of the time but fail in edge cases.
        People overvalue such biases. So violating them tends to be an insufficiently explored territory where you'll find good new ideas.
        When I read that even animals dislike being treated unfairly, I automatically ask "How could one benefit from being treated unfairly?"
        There must be edge cases where you're treated unfairly yet end up net ahead, and the bias against unfairness means they'll be underpriced.

        Here we go again. Most of antiviruses also marked MD5 collision demo -- non-malicious! -- as viruses for some reason :/https://twitter.com/showthread/status/834766682920980482 ... 
        Remember: things would be much more awkward today if @sleevi_, @arw and friends hadn't spent years working to rid the Web PKI of SHA-1.
        SHA-1 broken: http://shattered.io/  Switch from SHA-1 (and from MD5!) to BLAKE2, which is secure and much faster: https://blake2.net 
        New local priv. kernel exploit, patch:
        @uglypackets @daveaitel Correct--HMAC-SHA1 is still safe, even when truncated to 96 bits.
        Google announces first SHA1 collision https://shattered.it/ 
        Shell Factory is a framework for compiling shellcodes from a C++ source for multiple systems and architectures:https://github.com/gdelugre/shell-factory ... 
        Google says files sent via Gmail or saved in Google Drive are automatically tested against the SHA-1 attack. Here's what it looks like.pic.twitter.com/6Tg08Dvbvu
        "Google finds a SHA-1 collision": AFAICT the heavy lifting (cryptanalysis) is by Marc Stevens, and Pierre Karpman (who arent Googlers)
        Library and command line tool to detect SHA-1 collision in a filehttps://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection ... 
        SHA-3-based alternatives to #shattered SHA-1: FIPS 202's SHAKE, SP800-185's ParallelHash or ultra-fast KangarooTwelvepic.twitter.com/31tG4g9jyT
        So it's very unlikely that anyone will create rogue SHA-1 certificate any time soon. So do patch and get rid of SHA-1. And don't panic.
        Externally, Marc's https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection ...  is similar to how I worked around my bcrypt bug in 2011: detect attack, deviate from correct hash
        This is validation of the approach & API (safe by default even if technically incorrect, a force correctness knob), which I was uneasy about
        Internally, Marc's collision detector is much more complex, since it's SHA-1 design issue vs. my crypt_blowfish implementation bug (trivial)
        Implementation-wise, Marc's SHA-1 collision detector looks timing-unsafe (has if's) while crypt_blowfish's is timing-safe (bitwise ops only)
        Hopefully, those if's are low-probability (so the same code path is taken almost all the time outside of attack), but better to avoid them
        Finally, while crypt_blowfish's attack detector is timing-safe, bcrypt itself is cache-timing-unsafe (a separate and different (non-)issue).
        Unsafe: MD5, SHA-1, Mail.ru's SHA-1 & CRC-32 & size. Safe: HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1. Challenges: collide MD5 & SHA-1 at once, preimage attacks.
