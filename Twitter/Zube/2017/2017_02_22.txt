        @aaronportnoy amusing but so few people on there have any real data it ends up more bloviating than not.
        @aaronportnoy always amusing to see people insist that the govt should give bugs to vendors after x months. So insane.
        @daveaitel @aaronportnoy Reasonable conclusion, if you believe somehow government gets bugs accidentally in the first place.
        @ErrataRob @aaronportnoy it's super painful to watch.
        @ErrataRob @aaronportnoy these are such dumb, uninformed ideas it's amazing they are still floated publicly.
