        So much tooling around CAN bus, so few vulnerabilities or exploits.  Here are more tools: https://community.rapid7.com/community/transpo-security/blog/2017/02/02/exiting-the-matrix ... 
        
        Reminder that: number of groups who published vulns/exploits for cars: 3.  Number of those groups complaining about poor CAN tools: 0.
        
        Basically, CAN tools are the easiest part of car hacking and are NOT the bottleneck slowing down new research in the space.

        OTOH what happened with our election is that a bunch of psychopaths decided other people's lives and basic rights are a game... 3/N
        ...and then proceeded to tell people who face assault, never seeing their families again, etc. to get over "their team losing". 4/N
        Awful people believing this f*$&ing game metaphor is how we got in this mess to begin with. 5/N
        And it grew out of the same people who did the same thing gamifying harassment and death threats. 6/N

        A compromise is often a solution that no party is happy with. When leading a team, there may be phases where you can't make people happy.
        Makes sense to strive for a solution that everybody is happy with, but it may not always be achievable. Outliers on both ends.

        It can be particularly difficult to achieve communication style that everybody is happy with. What is simple & factual to one is harsh ...
        .. to another, what is friendly to one can be viewed as inauthentic, corporate, or passive-aggressive by the next.

        The celebration of billionaires is a symbol of aristocracy. Is this really the symbolism to emphasize now?https://twitter.com/brianneobrien/status/828946397382713344 ... 
        Yes. For the last 8 years Democrats celebrated aristocracy. Trump offends a lot of them b/c he's low class about it. https://twitter.com/that76spirit/status/828985919965392897 ... 
        If you want to #Resist what Trump is, then recognize he is the manifestation of concentrated power. That means recognizing cultural rot.
        And I'm sorry, but Obama palling around with billionaires is just who he is and has always been. It's just going to get more obvious now.
        Yes, esp. when Obama suggests he wants to lead a Dem Party revival.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/828986282995019777 ... 
        Fortunately the marches and anger against Trump are leaving the Old Order behind. The resistance is coming from the people and that's real.
        He could, oh I don't know, take a sweet long deserved vacation and not release pics kitesurfing with a billionaire.https://twitter.com/fsunoles1981/status/828988559977758720 ...
