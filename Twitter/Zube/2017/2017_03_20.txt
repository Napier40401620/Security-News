        I think it can be tremendously refreshing if a creator of literature has something on his mind other than the history of literature so far.
        If your brains were dynamite there wouldn't be enough to blow your hat off.
        I feel and think much as you do,care about many of the things you care about,although most people don't care about them. You are not alone.

        Congrats to @silviocesare, @kylieengineer, and the entire @BSidesCbr crew for a job well done. I hope to see you all next year!
        I'm hanging out in the Sydney domestic terminal for 90 mins if anyone's around and up for a yarn.
        When you take on something like CTF creation it's easy to underestimate the volume of work/effort involved. It's huge.
        Without a crew of top people, there's no way something like that can come together and work well. And so here's a few shout outs...
        First up is @Andrew__Muller from Ionize who sponsored the whole thing. The dude is a legend, and threw way more into it than you know!
        Then we have @Joflixen, another Ionize dude, who was relentlessly busy and did a stellar job of keeping our infra going the whole time. <3
        Next up is @aceb0nd, an unsung hero from Ionize who stepped up to build some crackin' challenges. Awesome effort, and super appreciated.
        More Ionize goodness from @rickoates as well, who's forensics challenges bent the minds of the best. Frickin' love this guy.
        The last of the Ionize crew was @0x42424242, the anchorpoint for the whole thing. Huge effort from him, and massive respect for what he did.
        The final compadre was @__sw1tch__, who absolutely nailed the vibe (lights/music) as well as the Mr Robot series AGAIN.
        We have throw a shout out to our beloved Ginger Ninja @justinsteven who threw in a cracker of a challenge that only a few managed to nail!
        So if you played/loved the @BSidesCbr CTF, give @Andrew__Muller @Joflixen @aceb0nd @rickoates @0x42424242 and @__sw1tch__ the deserved <3 !
        And that's a wrap! No more bleating about CTFs, I'm heading home to sleep for a week.
        Tomorrow: big update of #mimikatz
        This looks handy! Keen to find out if there's a way to make it work on windows 10.https://twitter.com/Hexacorn/status/842925483046162432 ... 
        BSidesCBR #done. Massive props to @TheColonial for those Pwn / Reversing challenges. Taught me heaps of new stuff and drove me insane.
        @TheColonial @sk3wl @BSidesCbr Great CTF. Great teams. Great fun. #bsidescbr #grouphug
        I've learned that there are still pockets of soul in Infosec. Glimmers of how it used to be. The Aussie scene is where it's at.
        @TheColonial the rule for us is, if you complain about a CTF you get to build one next year.
