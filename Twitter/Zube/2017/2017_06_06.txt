        1/ awful terror attacks like #londonbridge & manchester are going to keep happening no matter how much the west spends on counterterrorism
        2/ it's just a fact about the modern world that, if a group is sufficiently determined to kill some westerners in a horrifying way, they can
        3/ we spend huge amounts on counterterrorism efforts. this reduces the per-person risk of becoming a terrorism victim. to a very low level.
        4/ like, vanishingly low. we're more likely to die from a bear attack or a wood shop accident than at the hands of a foreign terrorist
        5/ but the risk of death from terrorism will never be zero. and the more we spend fighting terrorists, the less we get for our money
        6/ not to mention the intangibles we trade away for smaller & smaller marginal risk reductions (privacy, diversity, trust in each other... )
        7/ yet, after each terror attack, our politicians & pundits break out their "no price too high" rhetoric & call each other soft on terror
        8/ this touches off an availability cascade, in which everyone wants to spend more on defense and nobody's willing to say Stop
        9/ "oh, you think we're already doing enough to prevent terror attacks? THEN WHY IS ATTACK? WHY YOU LOVE MURDER?"
        10/ but of COURSE there's a price too high to save lives from terrorism! it's somewhere between zero and a nation's entire budget.
        11/ at some point, we have to pick a level of annual risk we're willing to accept & try to maintain that level instead of an unreachable 0
        12/ then we can respond to terror not by panicking & throwing more money at defense, but by addressing the underlying causes of terrorism
        13/ the underlying causes of terrorism include global wealth inequality and dependence on fossil fuels
        14/ we must reject politicians & pundits who feed on our irrational fears with a chant of "your government isn't protecting you"
        15/ we must seek out & support those leaders who will start down the decades-long, politically hazardous path toward real solutions
        16/ and we must accept that terror attacks are going to keep happening until they're no longer useful to those who would employ them

        If it hadn't leaked, Eternalblue would've faded into obsolescence before it was every rediscovered.
        - it is alarming that NSA & CIA tools are being leaked, but these are actions of a hostile intelligence agency that worked for decades in US
        ...dismissing this as "alarmingly easy" is actually alarmingly naive.
        - there are ETERNAL exploits that are extremely NOBUS. If they weren't, how come EternalBlue was used operationally for over 5y?

        The President's response to London-that the solution is more bigotry, more guns, more panic-is an embarrassment in a time of embarrassments.
        On 9/11/01, the immediate response of even our most craven politicians was supportive. Trump would do well to study & learn from this.
        Trump's exploiting London to push a gun agenda would be like Giuliani going on TV on 9/11 to defend his ferret ban.
        That thing where the ticket agent notices your email address in your reservation and asks about disk encryption sw for Kali Linux...
