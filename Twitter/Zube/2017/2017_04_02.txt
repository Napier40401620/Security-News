        Few will get this, but I was struck by how much 42 felt like NE43.
        From what one reads in the press, everyone seems to be pessimistic about France, including even the French.
        From what I've seen, they're in a better position than they realize.
        There is a huge amount of energy in Paris, and that's the most important thing.
        Few even here seem to realize it, but they already have the hardest part of the problem solved.
        US immigration policy seems not so much policy as individual agents targeting people, knowing they can now. Which is even more scary.
        For some reason our 4 yo has decided it's his birthday today. We're all going along with it, since it's his birthday.
