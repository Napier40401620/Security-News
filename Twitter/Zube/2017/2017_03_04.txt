        Today I found out many phishing sites process the data they receive with another master server, the hacked page is just the window-dressing.https://twitter.com/Techhelplistcom/status/837723738753888256 ... 

        This approach means that hacked websites just need to accept a simple file upload, they don't even need local code execution or storage.
        This is very similar to spam which tell you to contact someone other than who sent the email. It's easy to cycle the sender of spam.
        What's NOT easy for fraud spamers to cycle is the point of contact that users need to reply to. That address needs to keep working.
        So they send from one address, it gets blocked, but the user clicks an email address INSIDE the spam, that's rarely blocked automatically.
        One trick: Spammers send from http://outlook.com , Microsoft shuts down the account, but spam says to reply to http://gmail.com 
        Spammers heavily exploit silos of control to prevent one provider with an overwatch position shitcanning the entire operation at once.
        So you report that spam to Microsoft and they ban account, but Google never gets the report about their email INSIDE the spam, keeps working
        This kind of asymmetrical warfare by spammers and malware peddlers are why "shared threat intelligence" by major players is important.

        마음의 상처는 아름다움이나 유머를 만났을 때 치유되기도 합니다. 아름다운 자연 속에서 몸을 움직이면서 생각이 쉴 때, 유머 있는 사람을 만나서 마음이 밝아지고 편안해짐을 느낄 때 다시 온전한 본래 상태로 돌아가게 됩니다.pic.twitter.com/6vj1S9fMvc
        내 직장보다 훨씬 더 좋아 보이는 직장도 그 속을 아주 자세히 들여다보면 내가 전혀 상상하지 못하는 나름대로의 큰 고충이 있습니다. 그 사실을 깨닫는 순간, 내 현재의 직장에 감사를 느끼게 됩니다.pic.twitter.com/kyb9qyFI6G

        And yes, I know the war started in 2003. The vote and debate was in 2002, and the war vote was used to win the midterm.
        @matthewstoller not a Bush fan but "murdered" is the definition of hyperbole. Makes you look pathetic.
        So I guess the Iraq War and the bailouts are all just part of the foggy mists of time. No one was at fault. It's all good now.

        Offering a free account for open source projects on @dnsspy prompts many replies with folks that once open sourced a bash script.
