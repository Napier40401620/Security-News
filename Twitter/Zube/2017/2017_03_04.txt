+         Today I found out many phishing sites process the data they receive with
+  another master server, the hacked page is just the window-dressing.https://twit
+ ter.com/Techhelplistcom/status/837723738753888256 ...
+         This approach means that hacked websites just need to accept a simple fi
+ le upload, they don't even need local code execution or storage.
+         This is very similar to spam which tell you to contact someone other tha
+ n who sent the email. It's easy to cycle the sender of spam.
+         What's NOT easy for fraud spamers to cycle is the point of contact that
+ users need to reply to. That address needs to keep working.
+         So they send from one address, it gets blocked, but the user clicks an e
+ mail address INSIDE the spam, that's rarely blocked automatically.
+         One trick: Spammers send from http://outlook.com , Microsoft shuts down
+ the account, but spam says to reply to http://gmail.com
+         Spammers heavily exploit silos of control to prevent one provider with a
+ n overwatch position shitcanning the entire operation at once.
+         So you report that spam to Microsoft and they ban account, but Google ne
+ ver gets the report about their email INSIDE the spam, keeps working
+         This kind of asymmetrical warfare by spammers and malware peddlers are w
+ hy "shared threat intelligence" by major players is important.
