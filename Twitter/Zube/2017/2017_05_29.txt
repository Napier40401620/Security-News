        It's dishonest to claim that working at e.g. Google is merely targeting ads, not improving the world.
        Google search improves the world immensely. Ads are how they pay for it. Ads are Google's day job, not its whole focus.
        The fact that making money is not Google's whole focus is part of the reason it makes so much money.
        That is the secret weapon of nearly all big Silicon Valley companies. And it is one I can't imagine Wall Street ever duplicating.
