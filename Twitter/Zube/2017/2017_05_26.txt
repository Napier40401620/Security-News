        Just read through the BH USA agenda.  Some thoughts:  Nice to see old timers like @dinodaizovi and @zanelackey giving talks.
        I'd go see any talk by @XSSniper, including the one he's going to give at BH, https://www.blackhat.com/us-17/briefings/schedule/#when-iot-attacks-understanding-the-safety-risks-associated-with-connected-devices-6730 ... 
        I'd day about 95% of talks are by people I haven't heard of.  Welcome to the community new people, also I should get out more.
        The Keen Team from @TencentCorp is finally presenting their Tesla research from last September.  Should be interesting to see details.
        Talking about fuzzing seems to be making a comeback.  I thought we already knew how to do that, cc: @rantyben
        No new car hacking research since last September?  Let's get out there and hack some cars, people!
        Also thanks for not presenting/accepting any more CAN bus fuzzing talks...  I'm glad as an industry we've decided we have enough CAN tools.
        Oh one thing I forgot, my favorite talk title: BREAKING ELECTRONIC DOOR LOCKS LIKE YOU'RE ON CSI: CYBER https://www.blackhat.com/us-17/briefings/schedule/#breaking-electronic-door-locks-like-youre-on-csi-cyber-6083 ...

        so, under lisle's convention, every event from which information is *about* to reach you is simultaneous with the current instant
        e.g. if a star exploded 13B light years away & light from it is gonna reach your eyes an instant from now, then that star is exploding now
        this doesn't sound to me like anything that could usefully be called "simultaneity", but let's see where he takes it
        so "all stars were created simultaneously" where "simultaneously" means "at varying times over the previous billions of years"pic.twitter.com/PwtYiH27jE
        so in the reference frame of alpha centauri, for example, things had been going along for ~8.8 years before earth popped into existence
        he keeps saying this. i'm starting to think he doesn't know lorentz transform doesn't apply to non-inertial frames (e.g. an orbiting body)pic.twitter.com/PQ2Zhv0VuY
        oh god i'm in so deep that this paragraph makes sense to mepic.twitter.com/axyxM5pt7A

        i'm generally content to let people of faith believe whatever, even young-earth creationists
        but when they start trying to bring science into it, no, they can fuck right off
        it's interesting, though, to wonder if jason lisle (the author of the paper) knows it's bullshit. he's not stupid
        like i wonder if he inserted broken physics knowing it was broken, just to get his paper published
