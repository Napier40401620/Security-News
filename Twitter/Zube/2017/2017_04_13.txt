        Other than PCI-DSS, what other major drivers are there these days to adopt the OWASP Top Ten?
        If you have never contributed to open source because you think you're code is not good enough, please reconsider.
        I dont have a easy answer for who will do the work but we need an OWASP that originates requirements for vendors, not the other way around.
        I haven't. Top 10 is the flagship offering and M8, M9, and now A7, are basically "failure to purchase products".
        The new OWASP Top Ten categories need work but, I also do not think the project is useless. Funny watching trolls come out. #DoItBetterThen
        If you must use a software library in production that hasn't been well-tested for vulns, would you rather it be open-source or commercial?

        I recently tried out JW Marriott hotels in Singapore and Seoul. They are very nice.
        Lovely. My ranting against @united lost me 70 followers yesterday. I will miss every single one of them.
        My wife just texted "I'm too young to die" after they announced her United flight is overbooked.
        I wonder if the long term consequences for @united will be that when they ask people to leave the plane they will comply out of fear.

        Usually badness = room for competitors. Not optimistic that's true for airlines, but interesting to think about.
        The thing to focus on might be exceptional service. Travelers want cheap, and that might be the best cheap change.
        You could be qualitatively different by realizing that airline service defaults to bad, just as software defaults to insecure.
        One obvious step is to require feedback after every flight, a la Uber. Then you could use "seat racing" to find bad people.

        1) So @Arrow_dot_com is a Fortune 150 company (https://www.arrow.com/en/about-arrow/overview ... ), but they haven't configured SPF, DKIM or DMARC ? SERIOUSLY WTF?
        2) They make phone calls to get verbal confirmation of received invoices, & then email (without SPF|DKIM|DMARC) asking for confirmation?!?
        3) While MX records for @Arrow_dot_com -> Messagelabs @symantec, so inbound email to Arrow all seems good. Symantec: talk to your client!
        I love my hard-fail SPF & DMARC email policy, and using @dmarcian to see how spammers fail to take advantage of my domain. :D
        Thanks for signing your outbound emails using DKIM @Adobe!

        One thing left out of discussions about "how can we help Syria" is that basically no one cares about other people
        One good thing re Syria is any bitterness will quickly dissipate, it's only been 150 years & the South's starting to get over the Civil War

        It shouldn't be unlawful to write software of pretty much any kind. Virus Creation Labs in the 1990s? Totally fair game.
        But please do not insult my intelligence by saying that RATs are "dual-use", valuable for legit admins. No, they are not.
        I spent ~10 years doing security reviews for bona fide admin tools for F-500s. None of them disabled webcam lights, or had DDoS tabs.
        Here's a feature that is not especially important to enterprise admins: "finding and recovering all the passwords stored on the machine".
        Three real markets for RATs: 
        Fair point! Yes, dual-use in the sense that you need samples to test defenses.https://twitter.com/4Dgifts/status/852197498374565888 ... 
        You should be extremely suspicious of any argument premised on the idea that a RAT is/could be a legit admin tool.
