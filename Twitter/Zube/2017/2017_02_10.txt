        @matthewstoller Serious answer to this question: it's the price. Students who borrow $200K need to adopt certain beliefs to pay it back.
        @matthewstoller What you describe IS law school. The entire thing.

        It's a touch ironic that it's the free market that's letting ESR down
        Reading ESR's "Things Every Hacker Once Knew" strongly suggests that he's not strongly aware of what people know now
        Also, I'm very dubious of the assertion that B on the PDP-7 was an interpreted language
        Ah, apparently B compiled to something that was interpreted rather than compiling to machine code. Hm. Semantically interesting.
        It compiled to machine code on other machines, so was it an interpreted language or an interpreted implementation of a language?
        Also seemingly unaware of just how ridiculously common RS232* still is
        Stuff on parallel ports also seems wrong - the PC's DB25 was the first host connector that became common, Centronics was always device side
        The host end was also a socket rather than having pins, so anyone mistaking it for serial was already in a pretty bad place

        Software is eating the world implies immigrants are eating the world.

        Perhaps we should start calling the travel ban The Blessed Ban too, to emphasize how thoroughly Trump has been head-faked.

        Put your msbuild.exe arguments in msbuild.rsp, it is automatically loaded by msbuild & no command line args logged in say, Sysmon
        The more you use prescribed/approved developer patterns, the more difficult it will be to detect your activity.  msbuild.exe v4.0.30319

        ESR: "If I weren't concentrated on NTPsec I would have gravitated to work like the post-Heartbleed cleanup of SSL". HOW LONG CAN WE WAIT?
        Stuff like this is what bothers me about ntpsec: I think ESR really thinks nobody is working on OpenSSL; world is waiting for ESR to do it.

        @tqbf I assume the batshit thing here is that he thinks there is a university named University of Indiana.

        Thing computer security people have done for years that will hit the mainstream in 2017: burning their phones before crossing borders.
