        Porsche has an interesting model to opt-in to connectivity.  When you buy the car you need to have them put in a SIM card if you want it.
        By default, it doesn't come with a SIM card and so won't be connected to the Internet.  BTW, they use AT&T for their data services.

        Not yet finished, but it's looking like metsrv.x64.dll will lose about 80% of it's weight! That's 1.2MB down to 200KB.
        How? Making the reverse_tcp transport on Windows the same as all other platforms, and removing SSL. OpenSSL no longer there == way smaller.
        Before everyone freaks out, bear in mind that other reverse_tcp don't have SSL, and that reverse_https is still encrypted. You have choices.
        Coming in future TLV-level encryption and HMAC packet validation. ie. Better protocol-level stuff that isn't tied to transports.
