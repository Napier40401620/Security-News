        Several times in my life I've heard of small businesses nearly destroyed by the theft of tools/parts in vans/trailers. Interesting parallels
        Had it happen to us. Even hardening properly doesn't stop them, just slows down the dumb ones. So many stories.
        Worst part was reporting it to the police, who accused us of faking it for insurance...and here we're out $12k in tools and can't do a job.

        And if you're a Prominent Woman (or PoC or LGBTQ or anything) in Tech, you know this. And you shut the hell up.
        If you've ever wondered, "Why does Alice always talk about sexism but Woman1 and Woman2 only talk about happy tech?" This is why.
        In fact, I've more than likely spoken on their behalf.
        Women contact me all the time over DM. Sharing their stories. Asking me to tell them. Anonymously, of course.
        So I do. I've done this for several years now. I share the anonymous stories of women in tech.
        Even though it usually meant problems for me at work.
        Because SOMEONE has to do this. So it might as well be the blue-haired joker.
        I'm praised for my "candor" in many circles. But companies only want that candor in private, where it can be controlled.
        At the same time, they want to leverage your social media presence to make them look good.
        Be on this women in tech panel! Be in our company video! Be on our billboard! But don't ever fucking question us.
        I've seen many women in tech go through this cycle. They usually decide to stay quiet. It truly is best for their careers.
        My speaking out has hurt my career in tons of ways. Internally and externally.
        People usually think of me as a diversity expert rather than a technical leader. I assure you, I'm definitely the latter.
        The women whose stories I tell know the truth.
        Right now I'm in-between jobs. I didn't name my new employer for a reason. I wanted to be myself.
        Soon I may get quieter. I know you won't hold it against me.
        Just know I'm not alone.
        For the record: I'm very excited about my new job and company. I'm impatient to start.

        Blaming your predecessor for everything is not a policy doctrine.
        at the very least you'd think he'd open the second envelope
        Pouting about your margin of victory is not a policy doctrine.
        Complaining about how unfairly you're treated is not a policy doctrine.
        Trashing the candidate you already defeated is not a policy doctrine.
        Amazon's non-UPS/Fedex/USPS delivery service seems to figure out how to actually deliver my package about 2/3rds of the time lately.

        If the information about a meeting you email me is only in an application specific attachment instead of text, I will think ill of you.
        Also I will probably have no idea when or where your stupid meeting is.

        Eben Moglen has threatened and bullied multiple community members during his time in free software. Consider that before working with him.
        Eben's threatened to ruin careers and to sue people. He's given legal advice that contradicted an organisation he was general counsel for.
        He represents everything that's wrong with the free software community - a powerful man who can get away with things because he's powerful.
