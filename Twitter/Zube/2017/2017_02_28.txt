        I remember when Oscar toured the country, challenging locals to arm wrestling matches which, sadly, usually ended in gunfire. #Oscars
        The whole point to stand up comedy is to eventually sell sweatshop labor to those who are easily amused. Beats cleaning toilets! #Oscars
        If there's a porn parody of E! LIVE ON THE RED CARPET, it must be the blandest fucking ever recorded. #Oscars
        I'm wearing a fabulous white jacket that the Marriott in Miami will never see again. #Oscars
        Ryan Seacrest seems really attuned to social issues. 2020? #Oscars
        Hollywood celeb career anxiety is most profound, but I think their humility saves them. #Oscars
        I appeared in one Godard film. Don't ask me which one because I don't speak French. #Oscars
        Bette Davis would slap you. Just cold ass slap you. God, I miss that woman. #Oscars
        Halle Berry is stealing Phil Spector's wigs. #Oscars
        Remember, celebs love you. Don't bother running. Their love is too strong. #Oscars
        Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are the John & Yoko for people I don't want to know. #Oscars
        I watch American ads and weep for those Stalinist filmmakers who never had the chance. #Oscars
        The People's Choice Awards are off to a great start! #Oscars
        Billy Crystal's back just went out. #Oscars
        Mahershala Ali! Well deserved. #Oscars
        This is the part of the #Oscars that's like the radio silence when Apollo flights were on the dark side of the moon.
        How many journalists killed by Israel would get a Sting song on the #Oscars ?

        For two decades, users have been victimized by adware and extensions that change browser settings. Chrome alone had audacity to address it.
        Chrome blazed the path, now Flash and Adobe Reader and Firefox and more update silently and in the background. Now we have herd immunity.
        Extensions/outside software have long victimized IE and Firefox users, and are the #1 reason for crashes and performance issues in browsers.
        Another violator is security software, which is incompetently coded and interferes. Chrome has pissed off AV developers by kicking them out.
        At every single turn, Chrome's team at Google has faced incredible opposition and lobbying, including by users who didn't yet understand.

        Let's not give this moment any more attention.
        If your reaction to "marginalized people talk to each other" is "this could hurt ME" then you probably deserve it
        If people identifying bad eggs makes you nervous, it's because you are one and part of you knows it
        If you're worried about being "misunderstood" then you know you have behaviors to change. You just don't want to.
        Look, I don't walk around worrying that PoC are warning each other about me. I try to do right by those communities every day.
        But if they did, it's because I fucked up. I did something wrong. And that's on me to fix.
        And if you're worried about being "misunderstood" well now is the time to fix yourself.
        Start by following marginalized people on social media. Don't say anything to them. Just listen. Understand their lives.
        And if you've already fucked up, don't corner the person with questions and explanations. Apologize and move on. It's not about your comfort
        You have to educate yourself so you can do better next time. That's it.

        Also to whomever, thanks for the clever DoS, I <3 you too.
        P.S. re hack, look for ethertype 8866 on your net, if tcpdump/*shark doesn't see it on a realtek chipset, still doesn't mean not there
        Erm sorry ethertype 8899 RRCP is the problem that is hard to see not 8866
        Also whomever designed 8899RRCP, thought magic packets controlling your Ethernet hardware is a good idea? Esp. since  _everything_ uses RTL
        The next Q (thanks RPW) is since RRCP lets you tickle server innards on all the realtek wired chipsets, does it also work on wireless?

        *If* I can get out of bed at 5AM, my mornings are the most productive hours of the day. That in itself does not motivate to get up, though.

        So, lifehack: I'll enable a cronjob on my server that stops Apache every day at 5AM, triggering an alert, forcing me to intervene.
        Today's productivity was sponsored by the 5AM on-call alert.

        Idea: Start a new political party, and only allow a new D to join when you can recruit a new R as well (or vice versa).
        Advanced version: Make the new D (or R) find the new R (or D) themselves before they can join.
        To make this work, you'd be forced to discover a platform that would appeal a lot to moderates.
        Just as startups, in order to grow, are forced to discover an idea that appeals to users.
