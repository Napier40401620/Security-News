        If you need another reason to stop it already with the whiteboarding interviews...
        LRT asking questions makes women seem incompetent to men in power. Seen it in action.
        I know a woman who wasn't promoted. When she asked why, her male manager said she asked too many questions and was therefore less competent.
        Women ask questions because we want to do things right the first time. Men are rewarded as innovative cowboys for repeatedly screwing up.
        How do I always end up next to shitty guys and their dates
        This one mocked people who file their taxes on time because they need their refund checks. "Are you THAT close to the bone?"

        Stuff dumped past two days during Infiltrate was way more cool than the EQGRP dump. Specially the baseband talk which is so underrated.

        It's very strange that there are so many liberals for whom Trump was the new Hitler only up until the moment he actually started killing.

        This NYT piece NAILS IT regarding job interviews. As it says on the tin: they're useless.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/opinion/sunday/the-utter-uselessness-of-job-interviews.html?_r=0 ... 
        Researchers randomized answers from some (shill) candidates. Interviewers were MORE confident in inferences made from those interviews.
        Later told of the ruse, interviewers were asked to rank: (1) honest, (2) randomized, or (3) no interview.
        The right ordering: (1) no interview, (2) tie: honest or randomized interview. At least the randomized interview is honest about its nature.

        Make no mistake: the OWASP Top 10 is itself intellectually bankrupt. It's not taken very seriously. What it is is a very useful shorthand.https://twitter.com/aalvatar/status/851465611465109504 ... 
        This document is so weird. All access control moved to a single class, "broken access control". Impact: "moderate". MODERATE?
        OWASP "Prevalance" scale:
        New OWASP Top 10 candidate A7 should be renamed honestly, to "Failure To Purchase Security Products".

        Just the notion that there is or should be a "top 10" of appsec threats is so obviously bankrupt. How do we keep taking this seriously?
