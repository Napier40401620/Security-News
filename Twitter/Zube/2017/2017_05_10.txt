        New Yorker piece on liberals as Airbnb apologists ignores their support for private debt, asset bubbles, privatization of social housing 1/2
        Those policies explain alliance b/n liberalism & property-based gig economy far better than flawed assumptions abt conscious capitalism 2/2
        That New Yorker piece, albeit indirectly, reveals that big flaw of liberalism: it opts for intellectual explanations over materialistic ones
        "Free trade" today is just a euphemism for sector-specific protectionism - e.g. debt-fueled consumption surely protects the financial sector
        ...and the reason why consumption is fueled by debt, even if prices keep falling, has smth to do with shrinking wages due to "free trade"
        All of this seems obvious, no?

        Guys... is CVE-2017-0290 the bug everyone was freaking out about the last days? How come it took only 3 days from disclosure to patch?
        Looks like after all @taviso tweeting about having disclosed a bug to vendor has been best for customer protection.
        Unfortunatel fast patch time cause of @taviso tweet IMHO shows that PR trumps user security considerations.It was totally unecessary to rush
        I showed up at doctor 20 minutes before he opens. Already number 10 in queue 
        Since the last update my @spgassist iOS app is unusable. When you click on a hotel that you want to book the app just freezes.
        So i returned to the doctor and waiting in waiting room. I am sitting here for 37 minutes now and not a single patient was called.
        It seems all MacOS malware is totally crappy. I guess that is because owning Macs doesn't require much work.

        Basically after whole @taviso vs. Cloudflare disaster and the continuing drama it creates Cloudflare has to be considered a hostile vendor
        Anyway enough of this disclose nonsense. I just learned that I will be in hospital tomorrow and undergo surgery 
        Thanky you for the recovery wishes.

        Next week. Not today.

        If the USB stick you're installing from has an EFI system partition Windows gets confused
        Urgh OK confirmed that if AMT is enabled on wireless then it's accessible on *any* wireless network if running Windows
        Use your work laptop on cafe wireless and you may be vulnerable. This is probably a much bigger risk than publicly accessible wired machines
        Only applies if AMT is provisioned - following Intel's mitigation document will protect youhttps://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/26754/INTEL-SA-00075-Mitigation-Guide ...

        Remember that the distribution model isn't magically immune to backdooring of code:https://lwn.net/Articles/22991/ 
        Someone with control of a download site could replace the source tarball and in almost all cases it'd end up in distributions
        Sure, there's an extra opportunity for it to be caught compared to backdooring a binary release, but I'd bet 95% of attempts would succeed
        Infrastructure to ensure that source releases match git would help here. With reproducible builds, it'd leave git repos as the only target.

        Nice. If AMT is provisioned and enabled on wifi, it's accessible even if LMS has been disabled or removed.
        Windows firewall has no impact on it over wifi, too.
        If you have AMT enabled over wifi on any hardware that ever leaves your network, turn it off immediately: http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/48837.html
