        For the first time, I was suggested to make a workshop about crafting weird files... but is anyone interested if it's not for exploitation?
        Note that my goal in the long run is also to play with filesystems and magnetic storage - so that @a2_4am won't be bored in a few years ;)

        Similarly, it makes the decision of the few who refused to work on nukes on moral matters so much more powerful: "ethics trumped beauty".

        Sessions lying seems like perjury. His recusal & an independent probe seems like the only way to know if an ambassador meeting = treason
        Next up in the politics: GOP claims lying isn't perjury and Dems argue an ambassador meeting in a Senate office is automatically treason
        Modern liberalism is accusing people of being Russian agents if they suggest we need more facts before concluding that something is treason
        It's surprising that a senator who promoted Iraq War lies would lie to Congress about a nat sec issue. Its also surprising that water is wet
        Belated reminder that its now a normal not newsworthy thing that the CEO of Exxon is the U.S. Secretary of State.

        Dems' best voice demanding Sessions/perjury prosecution would be a fmr Obama AG who prosecuted Clapper for perjury. But that doesn't exist.

        1. Let's just talk about the point of the State of the Union. It's not about approval ratings, it's about governing.https://twitter.com/trash__fire/status/837285690752794624 ... 
        2. Every government agency, Congressional office, committee, lobbyist - they are all looking for guidance on their priorities.
        3. The President isn't just a guy on TV. He's also the manager of a $3T bureaucracy. The State of the Union is an important management tool.
        4. In the speech, what is and isn't included, and every word and phrase, is usually the result of thousands of discussions filtered up.
        5. That's why State of the Union speeches are usually boring lists of priorities. It's essentially a list of decisions the President made.
        6. It's a speech for a company-wide meeting. Vague platitudes without direction actually cause governing problems.
        7. After a day or two, pundits and voters forget about it. But the people that implement the wars and stuff - it's their guidance.
        8. Like this paragraph, in the 2012 speech, was the result of a massive four year fight over foreclosure fraud. It revealed a decision.pic.twitter.com/EtNG16jskk
        9. Anyway, that's how to understand a different way to see the State of the Union. It is for the people. It's also for the bureaucrats.

        2) MSWIN 2016 DNS does not support RFC 6844 CAA records. Does the support for RFC 3597 mean I can "hack" in CAA records afterall?
        3) cc @danyork @internet_nl @ivanristic (see thread)
