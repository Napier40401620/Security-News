        WhatsApp now encrypts iCloud backups with a key that they store for you. Neat, but doesn't pass the mud puddle test. https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/ ... https://twitter.com/iblametom/status/861566301877174272 ... 
        Apple (or iCloud creds) alone don't have access to plaintext anymore
        The SIM scenario is unfortunate, since seizing a device gives access to it, defeating phone FDE. (Indeed, it's what the article describes.)

        It's impossible to threaten @wikileaks without threatening press freedom. @Sulliview explainshttp://wapo.st/2pWehjY 
        Free press is like free speech: it means protecting press you hate as well as press you love.
        Want to get around 5th amendment? Declare someone "enemy combatant." Want to get around 1st? Declare press "non-state hostile intel service"
        To be clear, tho, I believe @wikileaks is an invaluable aid to democracy. The threat we face is too much secrecy, not too much transparency.
        If you believe @wikileaks is a Russian intel op, what are NYT, Wash Post, etc, which publish on same docs WL does?http://huff.to/2pWHMnR 
        Coda: why not include in your opinion @wikileaks own words? Here:

        interesting that ppl in infosec will demand a big salary and equity package but get bent out of shape at someone for ebay'ing a con ticket
        I find this ticket thing an interesting outlier in a industry where we  charge people as much as we can for products and services  1/x
        (someone's wallet) its now a "bad thing" to make money or overcharge.
        and we appear ok with this. (need  proof...get a quote from an endpoint agent vendor). Now that it's hitting closer to home 2/x
        we also seem to be getting pissed that someone did the equivalent of hacker shit against a hacker con. :-)
        I refuse to participate in the purchasing of scalped  tickets  but i dont understand the infosec SJW thing in this case
        BTW not trying to start drama for the Derby (or shmoo) crew.  They quickly addressed the issue IMO.

        Any gap between what the attacker prioritizes and what the defender prioritizes is really its own vulnerability -- @daveaitel

        This is true, and I had a whole section on this specifically citing a few examples, but had to cut it out due to time constraints (2/2)

        One thing Infiltrate taught me is that you don't have to pack in talks like sardines. If the talks are hard enough you can only take so many
        So our policy is to have breaks of variable length and never really kick people off stage or even tell them how much time they have left.
        Like if I invite pale Australians known for owningâ€‹stuff to speak, then they just speak till they're done. Otherwise you mess up the rhythm.

        Re my keynote, @daveaitel pointed out that mitigations aren't cost free - they in themselves can expand attack surface unnecessarily. (1/2)
        This is true, and I had a whole section on this specifically citing a few examples, but had to cut it out due to time constraints (2/2)
        Best recent example was this one heap overflow Flash introduced in their delayed free mitigation (https://www.offensive-security.com/AWEPAPERS/Exploit_Adobe_Flash_Under_the_Latest_Mitigation_Read.pdf ... ) by @guhe120

        It would be better if investors gave no reason when they turned cos down than their usual "it's not you, it's me" reasons.
        I've seen so many otherwise smart founders mistakenly try to adjust their companies after bogus rejections from investors.
        Next time you hear "It's a crowded market," or "We're concerned about your low margins," just translate them to "No."
        What distinguishes great founders is not their adherence to some vision, but their humility in the face of the truth.
        It's easier to tell Zuck that he's wrong than to tell the average noob founder. He's not threatened by it. If he's wrong, he wants to know.
