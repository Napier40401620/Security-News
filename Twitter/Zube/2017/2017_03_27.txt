        The tendency to yell at the bug discoverer versus at the delivery of buggy software is one of the most puzzling things about IT security.
        @halvarflake The number of developers who are happy QA found a bug in their code is low. Not '0', but low. It's not just security.
        Also: I have multiple people in my timeline say "shipping a product is so much harder". I have shipped products, I still cared about bugs.
        Fact is: Shipping products and playing fast and loose on security is economically rewarded. Vendor does not bear the risk.

        If PR/marketing teams do not like @taviso disclosing that he just reported a bug to them it is THEIR problem. Nothing unethical about it.

        Do you just think it's generally a good idea for government to investigate media over its content, or do you approve because it's Breitbart?https://twitter.com/earlgreene/status/845526990325272577 ... 
        Pretty sure it's not illegal for foreigners to own media companies, even if there were evidence of such. https://twitter.com/alanneff/status/845697553261907970 ... 
        Right, because Breitbart and Infowars couldn't be creating their own pro-Trump propaganda.https://twitter.com/timstone47/status/845699705652887552 ... 
        Okay. Good luck with that argument. Just don't complain when it's used against media you like someday.https://twitter.com/vinkayemkaren/status/845702242783105024 ...

        We are aware of a new report by @taviso and are investigating the issue now. Please stay tuned.
        .@ejcx_ @taviso breaking news: every vuln disclosure policy I've ever written (Symantec's, Microsoft's) also had that expectation.
        .@ejcx_ so y'all should stop singling out @taviso like he's acting outside industry norms for disclosure. He's not. Just let the man work.
        FTR: I still think everybody's wrong.
        Folks up in arms about @taviso 's industry common practice of disclosure upon patch maybe want to pick on ZDI too? http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/upcoming/ ... 
        The tendency to yell at the bug discoverer versus at the delivery of buggy software is one of the most puzzling things about IT security.

        Still can't believe a lazy incompetent goon with no interest in healthcare could fail like thispic.twitter.com/cXTxnAReKl
        How to be seen as a genius wonk:
        Trump can now move past healthcare and focus the rest of his presidency on his core competency: being on TV
        I strongly oppose making fun of Trump voters who feel betrayed but maybe we can make an exception this one timepic.twitter.com/ri5eHKkAsM

        What's going to happen is that Trump will get increasingly frustrated until he remembers that going to war really boosts approval ratings
        .@lystable takes $10M investment from Peter Thiel. Read the inspirational tale of one founder's courage here:http://fortune.com/2017/03/21/leadership-careers-advice-google-techstars-entrepreneur-startup/ ... 
        I understand the situation you're in if you took Thiel money prior to 2016, or are stuck with him on some other way. But in 2017?
        In 2017 if you accept money from Peter Thiel you are making a statement about your own character.
        Weirdly: if that statement is "I proudly believe the things that Peter Thiel believes about the world", I'm more OK with that.
        The fib-o-nazi joke is terrible and you should all feel bad about yourselves.
        Not sure how I feel about the state of the art of TLS feature development.https://twitter.com/grittygrease/status/845711264189992964 ... 
        Hey. If you're mad at @tavis for declaring the presence of bugs (no details were dropped! They have 90 days), you really need a better hobbyhttps://twitter.com/taviso/status/845728284755181568 ...

        @k8em0 @taviso my only gripe is there is not coordination of p0 report and public facing lastpass report. Instead p0 is dropped on patch
        The patch IS A PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, and one the most dangerous kinds: the kind primarily attackers can understand and act on.https://twitter.com/ejcx_/status/845732004121370624 ... 
        .@ejcx_ @taviso breaking news: every vuln disclosure policy I've ever written (Symantec's, Microsoft's) also had that expectation.

        Circulator hollandaise recipe: perfect.
        Announcing the existence of a vulnerability, without details, gives users a chance to take precautionary steps to limit exposure.
