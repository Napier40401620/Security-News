        Let your Discourse with Men of Business be Short and Comprehensive.
        The name of AMERICAN, which belongs to you, in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of Patriotism.
        It will be found an unjust and unwise jealousy to deprive a man of his natural liberty upon the supposition he may abuse it.
        The best way to preserve the confidence of the people durably is to promote their true interests.
        True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation.
        Men, who are familiarized to danger, meet it without shrinking.
        No country upon earth ever had it more in its power to attain these blessings than United America.
        Jealousy, and local policy mix too much in all our public councils for the good government of the Union.
        Example, whether it be good or bad, has a powerful influence.
        To persevere in one's duty and be silent is the best answer to calumny.
        To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.
        Labour to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire, called conscience.
        Truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light.
        To stand well in the estimation of one's country is a happiness that no rational creature can be insensible of.
        Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.
        There is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet an enemy.
        There is a rank due to the United States, among nations, which will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness.
        It should be the highest ambition of every American to extend his views beyond himself.
        Few men have virtue enough to withstand the highest bidder.
        Paper money will invariably operate in the body of politics as spirit liquors on the human body.

        I'm no security expert, but reading classified docs by light of camera-equipped phones seems at least as risky as having an email server.
        Wait, I suppose I *am* a security expert.
        Is Yale's Grace Murray Hopper college the first such thing named after a computer scientist in US? (There's a Turing College in UK.)
        Universities generally like to name things after donors; scientists and scholars tend not to qualify unless they're exceptionally important.
        Protip: if you try to defend the reading-classified-docs-by-cellphone thing, everyone is likely to think you're an idiot.

        4. Chicago schoolers refocused it on short-term price and output. You can draw a straight line from this change and Walmart/Amazon.
        5. Even as Walmart offers 'everyday low prices', its market power overwhelms republican institutions. Amazon is far far more powerful.
        6. Key to Chicago school revolution was to knock out concerns about vertical integration and predatory pricing.
        7. Vertical integration means buying up and down the supply chain, aka a movie studio owning movie theaters and so forth.
        8. Predatory pricing means short-term below cost price cuts to drive competition out of a market. In trade law it would be called dumping.
        9. @linamkhan uses Amazon to illustrate the revolution that this implied. "It is as if Bezos charted the company's growth...
        10. "by first drawing a map of antitrust laws, and then devising routes to smoothly bypass them."
        11. Lots of problems with Amazon's raw power, and I won't go into that here. Suffice to say that concentration is a serious global problem.
        12. There are two solutions, according to @linamkhan. The first is to govern through competition. The second is public utility rules.
        13. For the competition path, we should restore predatory pricing laws and tighten rules on vertical integration by dominant platforms.
        14. So for instance Amazon shouldn't be allowed to buy and monopolize the warehouse robotics market. https://www.therobotreport.com/news/filling-the-void-left-by-kiva-systems-acquisition-by-amazon ... 
        15. If Amazon can buy up robotics expertise and deny it to competitors, it forecloses on potential competition by raising barriers to entry.
        16. Prohibitions on vertical integration by dominant platforms would prevent this.
        17. The second path would be to treat Amazon as a public utility and regulate it according to nondiscrimination principles.
        18. Her point is that "Amazon increasingly serves as essential infrastructure across the internet economy". It should be regulated as such.
        19. This would mean resurrecting the "essential facilities doctrine" and applying it to fulfillment, marketplace, and web services.
        20. But @linamkhan's key insight is much simpler. Regulators and politicians have to start *seeing* market power again.
        21. The Chicago School of law and economics is designed to blind us to the politics of market power. It is time to open our eyes.
        22. Or as John Sherman put it, "If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade."
        Anything but engaging @linamkhan's argument about market power, I guess.https://twitter.com/pdmsero/status/831210568333791232 ...

        .@GeraldoRivera Thanks for opening the vault of your seriousness and character to show us all what is inside.
        Hacker News really _does not_ want to hear that encrypted SMTP mail is pretty much finished as an ongoing concern in 2017.
        Elon Musk, speaking in a city run by slave labor, says we must merge with machines or die. Pity the guy's PR rep:http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/13/elon-musk-humans-merge-machines-cyborg-artificial-intelligence-robots.html ... 
        Email/PGP: 
        Anyone who tells you you should put effort into setting up secure email should be viewed with _deep_ suspicion.
        @tqbf we're all still using icb, but hey at least it got moved off the cvs infrastructure machine
        "the cost of attacking someone using email and OpenPGP will be higher than for any existing alternative (including WhatsApp/Signal)"
        It is at this moment, 9:30AM in the Year Of Our Lord 2017, that I noped out of the encrypted email conversation on HN. Avenge me.
        The Linux on the Desktop types are doing more to hold back end-to-end encryption than anyone at NSA.
        Oh, shit.https://twitter.com/ducksecparty/status/831039644410089472 ... 
        -.- "fairly rigorously tested. Every primitive match their respective test vectors, and most constructions are tested for consistency."
        If your primitives don't match their test vectors, your tool doesn't even work, so pretty much everything is this rigorously tested.
        Actual live example of an ANTI-TRUMP fakenews site. This is what actual fakenews is:http://sacramentodispatch.com/trump-denies-ca-plea-for-federal-funds-cites-sanctuary-cities/ ... 
        Go to the front page, note also claims that Trump and Putin resort together, or that Trump removing vaccination information from CDC website
        Google "Trump Depression Disorder", also a a front page headline, and note it's covered on "http://HoustonLeader.com ".
        Now note that for several of "Houston's leading source for local news" local stories, you can replace "Houston" with "Sacramento" in Google.
        THAT'S WHAT FAKENEWS IS. It's not "news you disagree with" or even "news that is totally untrustworthy. Breitbart isn't Fakenews.
        I know we've already lost the semantic battle over this term but I'm not giving up, like that Japanese soldier stranded on a Pacific island.
