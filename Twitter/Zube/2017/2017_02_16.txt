        Liberals celebrating the CIA is nothing new. After all, it was a Dem creation.
        Liberals love the secret police, so long as they believe that they're not being targeted.
        Tagging Trump as a Russian operative is an attempt to beautify Hillary's horrid campaign and prove that there's nothing wrong with the Dems.

        @Pinboard I won election to my school board at 20...and re-election at 24. I'll answer anyone's questions about the process.
        Missed last night's City of Immigrants event? Donations are still matched: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/immigrantsbaltimore ... ; full video here: https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions/videos/10154937836632889/ ... 
        There is still $32,407 in matching funds left! Remember how David Simon killed your favorite Wire character? Now you can spend his money.
        Donation page is here. These organizations are doing lifesaving work, and your donation is matched. Don't delay! https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/immigrantsbaltimore ... 
        Remember your employer may match these funds, too. Please donate and tweet that you did! Don't leave money unused. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/immigrantsbaltimore ... 
        Who your donations go to: #1 is ACLU Maryland. Not the mink-coats-and-limousines national ACLU, but the real deal: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/immigrantsbaltimore ... 
        #2 is the Tahirih Justice Center, which supports the courageous women and girls who are fleeing gender-based crime. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/immigrantsbaltimore ... 
        #3 is the National Immigration Law Center. They've been out fighting for immigrants in airports and courtrooms. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/immigrantsbaltimore ... 
        #4 is the International Rescue Committee. They help the most vulnerable people in their time of greatest need. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/immigrantsbaltimore ... 
        All of these would be worth your donations without matching. But being able to also spend David Simon's money? The man who killed off Omar?
        There is about $30K left matched. Please give, and hector people on Twitter to also give. This is vital funding! https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/immigrantsbaltimore ...

        Hello @KellyannePolls,
        Although I am liberal-leaning, the Executive handles the People's interests against forgeign powers, so I want to help you. @KellyannePolls
        My 167,000 followers across industries and political classes are a testament to my principled stance for computer privacy. @KellyannePolls
        Let's set aside politics and promptly investigate this intrusion, @KellyannePolls. I believe in Country Before Party. I'm standing by.
        Additionally, I have senior contacts at Twitter itself with direct access to logs that can prove you didnt retweet that Nazi @KellyannePolls
        I can compare the Twitter OAUTH token and useragent on your phone against the hacker's and prove you didn't retweet the Nazi @KellyannePolls
        Additionally, we need to evaluate your phone/PC for a Remote Access Trojan that may be scraping your authentication tokens. @KellyannePolls
        With subpoena, we can get Twitter's logs of IP addresses + their geographic area to compare against your itinerary. Call me. @KellyannePolls
        Need to subpoena netflows from your cellphone to correlate against hacker activity, but r only retained only for short time! @KellyannePolls

        I wonder how much printer firmware research doesn't happen because nobody wants to brick the $8,000 office copier.
        Those things are expensive as hell, and you brick it you got to call someone to physically come out and flash it. It's all secretive. Sucks.
        We're a big customer and partner of a major printer company, took me 5 months to get a "No" asking for updated firmware to update our fleet.
        Their printer update process is apparently so fragile and contract-tied, they require a tech to come on-site and flash each one. Ugh.
        I'm like, I'd rather have an outdated printer than some rando dealer copier tech plug into our enterprise network to upload firmware images.

        By a vote of 23-15, Republicans just voted to not request President Trump's tax returns from the Treasury Department.

        Welcome to Idiocracy, vol. 5791: Carl's, Jr head Andy Pudzer, who prefers robots to workers, set be Labor Secretary.https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/12/09/john-stossel-interview-with-labor-secretary-nominee-andy-puzder/amp/?client=safari ... 
        @mtaibbi Carl's Jr believes no robot should go hungry.  You are an unfit president.  Your country will be placed in the custody of Carl's Jr.
        A boycott of Carl's Jr. - or all CKE restaurants for that matter - is the kind of protest that would actually hurt.https://twitter.com/kurtweldon/status/831930660537278464 ...

        The good news for POTUS is that accepting Flynn's sudden resg gave him leverage to negotiate the return of his phone. Such a deal maker.

        Considering how big a fan of @wikileaks Trump was, this is irony.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/831510532318429184 ... 
        Based on Twitter metadata, it appears up until this AM Trump's tweets this week were all from @DanScavino's iPhone. Then RAGE.
        So I guess it's true they're doling out Twitter time to @realDonaldTrump to wean him off it. Or something.

        Python is better for software engineering than Ruby.
        .@wvalters 3/4 of our first batch of clients are Python shops and I'm finding Python remarkably easy to reason about, far more so than Ruby.
        I like WRITING Ruby (or liked; I like static types so much with modern editors that I kind of hate both Py and Rb). I like READING Python.

        NTPsec advocates keep pointing out that they've eliminated 50% of ntpd vulns BEFORE THEY WERE DISCLOSED. 
        1. Since you can't really collect credit for eliminating vulnerabilities after they're disclosed, the emphasis there is a little weird.
        2. Can we get the list? Is there an easy place to see it? Were the vulns eliminated serious, and in default configurations?
        One more reminder that Trump fired Flynn only because he was caught.
        @tqbf 3. is 50% == 4 or 400 ?
