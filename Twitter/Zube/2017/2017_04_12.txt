        In a world where people defend torture and endless war, defending @united really isn't that heinous.
        Though the "libertarian" urge to defend corporate power over individual rights is sickeningly predictable.

SwiftOnSecurity

        Virtually every user and security feature you can think of in Windows 7 was actually introduced in Windows Vista x64. To incredible disdain.
        The failures of Vista obscured a simple fact:
        Developers having free access to the kernel had to change.
        For each of Vista's now-obvious security and stability advancements, Microsoft were decried as conspirators against their customers.
        There is no greater artifact of the mid-2000's populist backlash against computer security than the Gutmann paper.http://www.zdnet.com/article/peter-gutmann-turns-to-smear-tactics-with-help-from-pcworld-nz/ ... 
        Every evil security feature Microsoft was accused of developing in 2007, are the defining features of the platforms defeating them today.
        The entire world conspired against it - software vendors, hardware vendors, Microsoft management. But it saved Windows.
        Wes seems to be a little less sentimental about Vista, since I didn't mention the trash fire development process.https://twitter.com/getwired/status/851878862929534976 ... 

        Vista was still an unforgivably terrible product which wasted human-centuries of development in scarcely believable corporate dysfunction.

        United- WE ARE THROWING YOU OFF THIS PLANE!
        Congrats to this year's Pulitzer Prize winners:
        Someone just called GHOST TALKERS a romance. I'm like... um. It's a WWI novel. Oh. Right. I have boobs.
        I just took an hour long shower and the mirror wasn't even fogged when I got out. Where am I.
        Did the bathroom detect a rise in heat and self-correct? Am I aboard a self-aware ship?
        Yes, new reality accepted.
        Ships take care of all their crew, but every ship has its favorites.

        Proposed law re @united, part 1: Airlines _must_ call for volunteers. No more "involuntary". No exceptions. They overbooked; they pay.
        Proposed law, part 2: Airlines must pay volunteer in clear rebooking+cash or clear cancellation+cash. No more deceptively labeled vouchers.
        Proposed law, part 3: Airlines must pay $100/hour to each delayed passenger. Delay is measured by when door is opened at the destination.
        Part 3 is important because otherwise airlines have too much incentive to drag out the volunteering process for hours. Who wants $1?... $2?
        Finally, name passenger-rights law after the poor guy beaten up by @united, in the hope that the airlines never forget why the law exists.
        In Europe it's money + free food/beverage + free int. phone calls. For overnight, airlines must also provide hotel room and transportation

        Congratulations @united for Making Airlines Great Again.https://twitter.com/byrontau/status/851496946883846144 ... 
        United outsourcing customer relations to Chicago Police.https://twitter.com/braddjaffy/status/851500160580550656 ... 
        Re-accommodated with extreme prejudice.
        I hope if I'm ever violently dragged from a plane, other passengers will have the decency to video it in landscape rather than portrait
        I just published "When Automation Makes Passengers Freight: United Airlines and Seat Assignments"https://medium.com/p/when-automation-makes-passengers-freight-united-airlines-and-seat-assignments-d1f1ce440336 ... 
        I was raised to believe in the power of mocking humor against the powerful. But I suppose insufferably judgmental prissiness might work too.
        United still trying to justify its actions, sent letter to employees today trying to explain why it treated that passenger so brutally.https://twitter.com/fmanjoo/status/851578419598966785 ... 
        All airlines NOT equally bad here.https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/851583216301559808 ... 
        Dear United: If what you're trying to do is ruin your reputation, I believe that I could do it far less expensively than your current team.
        Cue "wouldn't have happened if he had just complied" and "he's just looking for a big payday in court" nonsense.
        an airline shouldn't use the phrase "left with no choice" unless you're landing on the Hudson or your crash survivors turned to cannibalism
        In fairness, I should note I was re-accomodated on another flight today, with NO aisle dragging involved. Nice improvement @united!
        Ouch @united.https://twitter.com/MerriamWebster/status/851602942037819392 ... 
        As if horrible mistreatment by @united & Chicago PD wasn't enough, @courierjournal runs disgraceful "he's no angel" hitpiece on the victim.
        It's reassuring to find fault with the victim in clearly outrageous incidents like @united, so we don't have to think it could happen to us.
        "Nothing like this will every happen to me, so no problem. After all, I'm not a doctor, and I never fly on that route."
        For those of you who don't know @billpollock , he's the most calm person you will ever meet. @united even had problems with him #AwfulPR

        This is a real issue, but the Qubes shoutout largely misses the point that in this case Qubes is only unaffected if user behaviour changeshttps://twitter.com/micahflee/status/851842219052945408 ... 
        A lot of Qubes (like putting a bunch of resources like firewalls and USB) in separate VMs is a huge win, and I want to see that everywhere!
        But the other benefits largely rely on users doing the right thing - opening PDFs in disposable VMs, handling private data in the private VM
