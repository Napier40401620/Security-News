        Witnessed the worst interview ever. The candidate was nice and sorted however the interviewee was half assed and was playing with him. 
        Typical Indian IT helpdesk interview. Candidate suppressed with the inferiority complex of interviewer.

        Kudos to the guy who was being interviewed. Met him, shook hands and admired his patience. Wished him, a better tomorrow.
