        Our industry is run by religious zealots who, unfortunately, have access to all the money. The religion is apocalyptic AI transhumanism

        The sad part is that basic gerontology research is, in fact, hideously under-funded. But instead they're throwing billions at... nothing.
        I hate AI religion because it persuades wealthy tech people to ignore urgent, solvable problems and pour their vast resources into fantasy
        I wish Ray Kurzweil a long and happy life, but I'm throwing a big party when he dies

        First he told the server his order but asked her to hold it for 20 min to better fit his preferred timing
        Then he told her to change the tv to something he wanted to watch. A tv that 10+ people were watching.
        I can learn to advocate for myself and speak up in meetings and give myself credit for my work but I will never treat public spaces as mine.
        Like, it's an airport restaurant. Everyone is maybe 90% comfortable max. But he deserved that additional 10% and fuck everyone else.

        I think people read my twitter and think I hate all white men, which isn't true at all.
        First of all, I also hate white women.
        Second of all, I work with, befriend, and date white men. Very good white men.
        But you don't get cookies for being a decent human being
        And pretty much every asshole I run into is a white dude
        So if you want me to stop "bashing" men, come get your boys
        My male seat mate is somehow manspreading with his elbows into my hip and I'm seeing red
        He's not a wide person. There is no reason for this.
        He's also made multiple calls asking for extensions on college decisions (I think grad school?) something I would have never thought to do.
        Asking for an extension would have been a sign of failure for me.
        Bless all of you discussing diseases for me to fake to scare off my seat mate
        he's newly single, ~ladies~pic.twitter.com/DCh1NusEBu
        Btw the second pic was promoted by me saying I hope he finds someone to talk to. That's it.
        My therapist: "oh I love the color of your shirt - what's it say?"
        I really wanted to do work on this bus ride except the wifi is broken, so instead I'll relay that seat mate is doing lunges in the aisle

        This is the behavior of zealots. What has turned them into zealots? Not the economy: the economy doesn't do that.
        My guess is that they're driven by a deep, identity-based dislike of liberalism. They despise NPR culture, partly because it despises them.
        That's why that remark about "deplorables" provoked such a reaction.
        Google's dominance in search seems a cash cow almost as dangerous as Microsoft's dominance in operating systems was to them.

        I got no inside info, so can make a guess: this is a readiness testing (1 of many) for RU Internet cutoff went wronghttps://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/russian-controlled-telecom-hijacks-financial-services-internet-traffic/ ... 
        That some readiness testing for Internet cutoff was/is being performed in RU since 2014 isn't even a guess, nor a secret
        A concern, also publicly expressed, is that if RU is cut from the Internet, it'd impact financial transactions involving Visa & MC inside RU
        As a result of such stress-testing of impact, Rostelecom would readily have a list of relevant prefixes configured on some access list, etc.
        I wouldn't be surprised (and now this is a guess) if they'd be also testing workarounds, including hijacking Visa & MC inside RU
        I guess this wasn't meant to leak to public Internet now, and never outside of RU, and was only meant to keep RU-issued cards working in RU

        This is another hugely important point. The word "union" connotes regulated compensation and "shop rules". Doesn't have to!https://twitter.com/alicemazzy/status/857666014670077952 ...

        They just can't help it. Even when blaming Obama unwittingly creates examples that can be used to discredit every other attempt to blame.
