        The Shadow Brokers Reveal New Details About Their Subscription Plan For NSA Exploits http://bit.ly/2rmDwyK  #cybercrimepic.twitter.com/XDU7wQ18oh
        what I don't get is any big corporation can do the right thing and buy it easily.
        @hackerfantastic  tweets about worlds first open source cyber arms deal and then lion king bloopers, love this guy lol
        Ethical debate: OK to pay Shadow Brokers for exploit dumps?

        I am well aware of divided opinion amongst infosec experts, the debate is equally as important as the outcome. It's very 50/50 split so far.pic.twitter.com/6VCK5dSK7F
        For every person who disagrees with this course of action, another agrees. It is entirely subjective to the individual. It's just an option.
        In my opinion it is not OK, but it looks like the lesser of two evils.

        As I said, I agree w @hackerfantastic that this is like a bug bounty from E Corp. Evil, but a lot of people get hurt if infrastructure drops
        People can disagree but bad actors *will* pay and get hands on the dump. Everyone will benefit from the upcoming patches.Reasonable approach
        For the backstory see: NSA-leaking Shadow Brokers are forcing a gamble on whitehats w/ previously unimaginable risks https://arstechnica.com/?p=1106561 https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/869894325420904448 ... 
        This debate on how to deal with #ShadowBrokers that @hackerfantastic and @x0rz have spawned is interesting to observe.
        Its nice of @x0rz and @hackerfantastic  to start the patreon. Great intentions. Feel that SB is trolling and ifnot seems industry should pay

        RT to *demand* an explanation from @PressSec at today's press briefing.
        #denfÃ¸lelsen nÃ¥r @NilsApeland sier til deg "Bra foredrag."
        Har lÃ¦rt at det finnes noe som heter "Verdens Passord-dag". Det burde feires hardere. #statusnorge
        Er @KjellTech pÃ¥ #statusnorge??? 
        HÃ¸yre sender sin epost via Danmark. Arbeiderpartiet holder seg til Norge. HÃ¸yre dermed eksponert for avlytting.
        Da sier jeg takk for meg @TriggerOslo #statusnorge, og husk: regelmessig skifte av passord er noe stort tull!

        We (@x0rz and me) have decided to attempt to crowd source the funds and buy the @shadowbrokerss exploits - detailshttps://www.patreon.com/shadowbrokers_crisis_team ... 
        IMO the crowdfunding it's a way of giving the *least* amount possible to SB while giving the possibility for vendors/FOSS dev to catch up
        So yes, it's bad and good. You make your choice. Don't hate the player hate the game? 
        We're just trying to do the right thing here, which is enabling early access to vendors and FOSS that are vuln to 0days
        we will notify vendors and share data with any researchers who are involved. we will be expecting responsible disclosure practices.

        People being judgmental all of a sudden. When you had for years a wealthy black/grey market for 0days, we ain't enabling "cyberterrorists" 
        The #ShadowBrokers aren't interested about money, but just media coverage IMO
        My guess is they will release the tools/exploits anyway, that doesn't prevent us to make a bet they won't?
        In that case getting early access (if they deliver) is a great opportunity to help mitigate exploits on vulnerable software
        It's just psychological now, fucking with everyone else. I guess they'll want to dump what they have before it becomes too dated.
