        Like premature optimization (the root of all evil), is there an analogous concept of "premature hardening"? Are cons comparable?
        By premature hardening, I mean hardening (of nontrivial complexity) performed "because we can" (or "because it generates papers")...
        ...rather than "because data indicated it might be the most effective or efficient method to mitigate likely vulns".

        @halvarflake According to PCI-E specs -- a sane device should not send any memory write LTPs while this bit is zero, but it actually can :)
        @halvarflake A while ago Bus Master was a physical signal, but with PCI-E it's just a legacy notification bit which can be ignored by device
        Have you know that PCI-E device actually doesn't care about Bus Master config space option? It can read and write host memory in any casepic.twitter.com/EitgD5fMSe
        PCI Express is not a bus, it's a network: obviously, at this level there's no such thing as bus master/slave conception

        When people are doing badly at something, they look for complicated solutions because the obvious ones are hard.
        One place where it's ok to use complicated solutions though is in choosing which problem to solve.
        If you're a struggling pre-med, the answer is not always simply to work harder. Maybe there's something else you'd rather do.
