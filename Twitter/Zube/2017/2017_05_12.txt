        "It's like they type on your keyboard."
        One of the biggest things people don't understand about startups is how far they have spread beyond classic "tech."
        In fact a fruitful source of startup ideas is to look for a domain where there haven't been startups and ask how you could introduce them.
        Freight forwarding? Check.http://www.aircargonews.net/news/forwarders/single-view/news/flexport-to-invest-in-cross-doc-facilities.html?Continue=1 ... 
        It's not just software that's eating the world, but startups specifically.
        Startups may actually spread faster in domains that haven't previously had them, because there is no acquired immunity to them.
        There's more room to delight customers in a domain where the incumbents are lazy.
        Since incumbents can't win by making something better, the ultimate limit to the spread of startups may be regulatory capture. E.g. Airbnb.
        It's a challenge to write an essay in which each 140 chars works by itself. Not an impossible one, but it does make the tone a bit oracular.
