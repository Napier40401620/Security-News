        Adding better use-after-free detection in BugId led to rewriting some related code, which led to adding a few more features... :)
        * Improved call stacks symbols
        It's running reasonably well on my fuzzer farm. A few bugs need to be addressed before I release. Thanks to those that reported issues!
        Protip: If WinDbg gives a bad symbol in a call stack frame, use the return address to look at the call instruction for the called symbol.
        Works only for direct calls (opcode E8).
        I've looked at trying to do this for indirect calls with hardcoded addresses, but found many were to wrapper code that did "JMP register"...https://twitter.com/berendjanwever/status/855379369832964096 ...

        Okay, this nut is finally cracked: I turned the Win Server 2003 into a domain controller and ESTEEMAUDIT works. No smartcard support needed.
        The NSA toolkit uses PKI for implants, why was it not also safeguarding exploits in a similar way? That way the leak would not of worked.
        It's impressive how ESTEEMAUDIT migrates its payload to an already running svchost.exe to avoid leaving a suspicious process running.
        Also impressive how it loads the DLLs it gets from the attacker directly into memory. You don't see them in Process Explorer.
        This is not magic, the code to do all of this is public but no pentest team would do this because economy. Real world of spies is different.
        I can think of a number of PKI certificate based licensing that framework could of used, may of prevented unauthorised 3rd party use.
        The lesson to be learned from leak is not that nations build cyber weapons, it's that we are not building sufficient safeguards into them.
        NSA used symmetric keys to protect implants from unauthorised C2 use, binary protections on the exploits could of benefited from PKI license
        As a civilian, a toolkit like this should be highly difficult for me to run. It should of required authorised certificate or hardware token.
        Lesson for the adversary, add runtime encryption on CNE assets that require x.509 certificate and/or hw token to use from operative system.
        If the CNE asset also requires a trusted certificate authority which is protected internally from issuing certificates...  mission impossible?
        It certainly isn't fool-proof but it would help with attribution of any leaks (who, what, when, where) and deter use by 3rd parties.
        Payloads need to be portable but do exploits need same level of portability? You wouldn't copy stuff like this laterally around a network.
        Don't do this, running 3rd party binary exploits downloaded from unknown hackers is not a good idea especially on other peoples systems.https://twitter.com/chopper_sec/status/855335747255025664 ... 
        True! Please pentesters - do not run any exploits against your customers that you don't have source code for. I.e., don't use NSA tools!https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/855336572794789888 ...

        This is FlexiSpy's founder Atir Raihan, who has profited from selling malware to people to spy on their spouses https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-flexispy-the-company-getting-rich-selling-stalkerware-to-jealous-lovers ... pic.twitter.com/d741b6W6Ek
        Raihan was ambitious. In a document obtained by Motherboard, Raihan said his malware would be sold in all countries https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-flexispy-the-company-getting-rich-selling-stalkerware-to-jealous-lovers ... pic.twitter.com/JroBYbWbKH
        Raihan allegedly installed spyware on company laptops before issuing them to staff, a former employee said https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-flexispy-the-company-getting-rich-selling-stalkerware-to-jealous-lovers ... pic.twitter.com/4XFaCjAOS0
        FlexiSpy's malware is not limited to just one company though. It has a network of resellers across the world https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-flexispy-the-company-getting-rich-selling-stalkerware-to-jealous-lovers ... pic.twitter.com/5YI35rtgmd
        But THIS is where it gets interesting. Several docs lay out a relationship between FlexiSpy and Finfisher https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-flexispy-the-company-getting-rich-selling-stalkerware-to-jealous-lovers ... pic.twitter.com/rATEWF2XI0
        As we all know, Gamma/FinFisher went on to sell malware to Turkmenistan, Turkey, Egypt, and more https://citizenlab.org/2015/10/mapping-finfishers-continuing-proliferation/ ... pic.twitter.com/r0fSF9WbLK
        So that's how FlexiSpy went from being a software dev in Thailand to mingling with malware for regimes. More details/sources in story.

        Ellen Pao explaining that seeing other women go through the same experiences as her was what inspired her to take action #AnitaEllenSpeak
        It's almost always the case that the burden of raising awareness and taking personal risk ends up on those who are already suffering
        Anita Hill now describing how private settlements in harassment cases mean it's harder to establish that a pattern exists #AnitaEllenSpeak
        Now explaining that a culture that respects everybody in a community isn't willing to make excuses for harassment #AnitaEllenSpeak
        (which implies that communities that *do* make excuses are communities that don't have genuine respect for all members) #AnitaEllenSpeak
        Ellen Pao says current tech VC is shaped by men who came from foundational tech companies and brought the culture with them #AnitaEllenSpeak
        In turn they fund companies that resemble that culture because it's what they associate with success #AnitaEllenSpeak
        So, even in a relatively young field, there's strong pressure to maintain that (white male dominated) culture #AnitaEllenSpeak
        Anita Hill says we should ask people who argue that no bias exists to show that rather than them demanding the reverse #AnitaEllenSpeak
        Ellen Pao encourages ally training as a mechanism for helping avoid placing all the burden of fixing things on the victims #AnitaEllenSpeak
        Anita Hill explains that she put up with Thomas' behaviour because at the time she didn't understand she wasn't the problem #AnitaEllenSpeak
        Anita Hill argues that employers need to investigate not only complaints, but the reasons those complaints can exist #AnitaEllenSpeak
        Anita Hill says Joe Biden has never apologised for or explained his complicity in her Senate hearing smearing #AnitaEllenSpeak
        Ellen Pao describes how letting harassment incidents slide in the early days of a company hurts recruitment ability later #AnitaEllenSpeak

        Actually it's rather flattering for Silicon Valley that people are surprised when a startup sells a bogus product.
        Technical debt is bad, but (more often than not) optimal.
        Interestingly, incurring technical debt tends to be the optimal strategy for individuals as well as for startups.
        Young programmers are better off not starting with the theoretical foundations of CS, but by eagerly writing crappy programs.
        That sounds obvious, doesn't it? And yet few if any schools and universities can bring themselves to teach programming this way.
        How's Trump doing?
        Journalists: You may loathe Wikileaks, but if they're prosecuted you're next. Wake up, right now.
        The problem with being a political extremist is not so much the extremism per se as that it makes your ideas so boring.
        Ideology is like a fiercely prim Wodehouse aunt that makes your thoughts sit up straight and be quiet instead of running around outside.

        I don't get along w/ Julian Assange but prosecuting him for publication alone is a grave threat free press everywhere.
        I worked as a communications consultant for Wikileaks from February, 2014 - December, 2015.   Bulk of GJ investigation was centered on CFAA
        Obama admin signaled they didn't want an indictment paired w/ publication &  pursued an angle under CFAA. Strange to see this under Trump.
        Timing on Assange complaint is peculiar with recent #ShadowBrokers dump. I don't know if older EDVA GJ charges solidified or if this is new.
        This would be incredibly dangerous for press freedom & all reporters. I hope even WL's harshest critics in the media will denounce this.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/855171242344812546 ...

        HN twists itself into a pretzel over the observation that other countries have less tech gender disparity: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14164600 ... 
        Bullshit rationalization after bullshit rationalization.
        All of them fall apart when confronted with a simple fact: gender disparity isn't a STEM problem, it's a tech problem.
        CS, physics, and engineering: those specific fields share a strong bias against women. ALL THE REST OF STEM DOES NOT.
        In particular, mathematics, which is so thematically similar to CS that it used to house the CS departments, has far better parity.
        There are STEM fields that have slightly better female than male representation, like molecular biology.
        ...  curious, right, because you assume a molecular biologist in 2017 does a whole lot of computer work.
        Misogynists (that's what they are) on HN make each other feel better with just-so stories about economics and choice.
        But they're no more credible on this subject than on cryptography or law or political science or for that matter programming. 99% bullshit.
        What is it that repels women from CS/tech but not from mathematics or molecular biology?
        My favorite nerd rebuttal to this "what about nursing?"
        I'm going to have that dumb Morphine song stuck in my head all morning.
