        Trump's chaos keeps the GOP from enacting its reactionary agenda (for now). President Pence ushers that through with little resistance.
        If the Dems were serious about #Resistance, they'd focus on single payer, not Russia. But they love the imperial-corporate system.

        There is a tragic flaw in our Constitution, and I don't know what can be done to fix it. This is it: Only nut cases want to be president.
        A step backward, after making a wrong turn, is a step in the right direction.
        Another flaw in the human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance.

Pinboard

        The advance work on this trip is hilarious:
        Everyone freaking out, it's a GLOBE
        I just learned about webassembly today and I can't even make fun of it yet. My brain is trying to protect me from forming the concept
        I made my argument for a social media travel mode here: http://idlewords.com/2017/02/social_media_needs_a_travel_mode.htm ...  A way to give your passwords without giving up your friends
        The next Seattle @TechSolidarity meeting is tomorrow night! 7pm at the Labor Temple. Our speaker is Marcus Courtney. https://seats.glitch.me/ 
        Last week it was all impeachment explainers, and then Trump jumped the county line into Saudi Arabia, hootin' and hollerin' in Air Force One
        "Google has so many tentacles in so many pies that it was mind-numbing to see them all sardined into a single event"https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/21/google-in-google-out/ ... 
        Watching Saudi Arabia welcoming favourable foreign press all while blocking international journalists from entering Yemen.
        Consarn it, them Trump boys got us again!  Better go back to the courthouse and design another ramp-shaped trap:https://twitter.com/illologist/status/866599090112651265 ... 
        I'm a good old boy
        Hearing a lot of people explain that 265 frameworks and a 19-step compile chain is a sign of dynamism and vigor in frontend development. OK!
        Not sure the industry can stand much more of that dynamism and vigor. But for now, keep crushing it!
        A travel mode for social media is not a perfect solution. But it's much better than the status quo (full archives available everywhere)
        If you think limiting Facebook access for travelers would make things worse, argue that. But dismissing it as a partial fix misses the point
        People are getting arrested entering the UK for violating the Terrorism Act by not providing passwords. A travel mode would protect them
        Big tech company employees have a travel mode they turn on when visiting China. They have the technology, they just don't care to enable it
        Also it's a travel mode, not an evasion mode. There are many reasons to limit full access to your accounts while you're in unfamiliar places
        I am so sick of hearing this tired clichehttps://twitter.com/tqbf/status/866676778378592256 ...

        I have this Win10 Enterprise vm that I was using to test out various privacy settings. Here's some of the stuff I found out so far...
        Recommended demo and article, for so many reasons
        via @IdleWog -  thanks man!
        Wir laden euch ein zur ersten deutschen Bundesdatenschau -- Daten aller Art sind samt ihren Besitzern willkommen!
        So, I stayed up way too late last night and made a thing:
        Is there any way to align EDD images? (even 'artificially', just for visualisations purposes)
        Am I the only one who wants to draw on floppies?
        People interested in these floppy images may like Qkumba's article on Apple ][ copy protections

        in the 90s when there were as many DNS servers on the Mathematics network as machines. Why did we install a server distro for X11 clients?
        This isn't to say that Windows & Linux do not have their place, just not *that* place... 
        Note: Italian tri-phase catenary was an engineering folly of the late 1920s which sort-of made sense at the time. It was deeply regretted... https://twitter.com/cynicalsecurity/status/866582802858377216 ... 
        when they then had to migrate it to the current 3kV DC catenary from the late 50s. Well into the 80s there were sections where speed... 
        restrictions were due to adapted tri-phase catenary infrastructure being used on critical lines.
        Does anyone know what replaces autodiskmount on macOS 10.12? @osxreverser? I want to automatically mount external disks at boot... 
        Note on the note: in the 1920s Italian industry knew how to build a powerful three phase AC motor but not a DC motor so, when the issue of... https://twitter.com/cynicalsecurity/status/866589247070973953 ... 
        electrification of the mountain pass routes came up the choice was dictated by hydroelectric power generation (3-phase), what the national... 
        industry could build and, most importantly, getting off coal which Italy did not produce in great quantities. So 3-phase was the answer... 
        which solved these issues at the time. DC motors developed much faster than had been expected and 3kV DC became the choice for new lines... 
        in particular the "Direttissima" between Florence and Bologna of the late 1930s. This left 3-phase in limbo and eventual phase-out.
        Contrast this with the Swiss who went 15kV AC at 16 2/3 Hz immediately for the Simplon & Co. with Brown Boveri providing the AC motors.
        The Italians went for 3kV DC because they could keep substations at longer distances (i.e. cheaper) and minimised loss over cables.
        The pinnacle of 3kV DC being the Florence-Rome "Direttissima" designed for 250km/h and not trivially upgradeable because of power issues.
        So, ultimately, 3-phase AC was the best possible engineering decision given the constraints *and* the emphasis on national-only resources.
        It was also a decision which cost dearly in terms of interoperation between 3-phase AC and DC lines and the eventual conversion.
