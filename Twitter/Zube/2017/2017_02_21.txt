        Sometime in the next 48 hours a hit piece will come out to try to discredit @susanthesquark. I encourage you to ignore it.
        I know too many women whose follower counts skyrocketed as the result of public humiliation and professional harassment.
        Too many people discover talented women by picking through their pain.
        This is the first reaction to a woman in tech's account of sexism/harassment that the tech community seems to *actually believe* 1/6

        It's called a period, Boots. Menstruation. WOMEN BLEED OUT OF THEIR VAGINAS WHY CAN WE NOT DEAL WITH THIS? WHY?pic.twitter.com/3dLgoTzhQ7
        Women who experience harassment at work want to trust our companies. But the first thing many of us learn: HR isn't there to protect us.
        The second thing many of us learn: if he's senior (and he almost always is), not moving or losing him is more important than keeping us.
        At an old job, if the sole HR person did something to help employees, their days were numbered. We went through many.
        Every time we got a new one, we would try to use them. As soon as it worked, we had to wait for the next hire to try again.
        Usually it was something like getting paper copies of pay stubs. Management didn't want us to have an easy way to keep track of pay.
        My manager would even intercept HR so employees couldn't get their requested documents. Then HR was gone.
        HR was always a young, attractive woman there to look good. So many of them wanted to do the right thing. They learned.
        I never asked them to do anything because I didn't want them to get fired.
        You know all those times when a woman speaks up about not having women's t-shirts when the guys get free ones? We're testing you.

        Just so you know almost everything in that Uber story has happened to most women you know in tech at some point or another
        It's unsurprising that Uber is a trash fire but it's not uniquely bad in this respect
        The most important thing you can do when you hear about this kind of story is believe it, and not just when the company in question is evil
        Sausalito is *very* white
        Travis's statement means that if Uber *don't* fire a bunch of people, it'll be an implicit statement that they don't believe the claims
        It's a great way of saying "We investigated and found nothing" without even having to pretend to do the investigation
        Reminder that you don't hear about a lot of these cases because companies force people to sign NDAs on the way out

        Uber employees in my Fb friends-of-friends UNHAPPY about the Fowler thing. Now if only there was a way for them to meet in a single place... 
        ...  and if only there were a law that could, I don't know, protect them? If 2 or more of them decided to engage in, hm, concerted action?
        Maybe what makes this tricky is that they don't have a simple demand. Like, replacing what is notoriously the worst HR department in SFBA.
        A crazy dream. It's not like Uber is UTTERLY DEPENDENT ON THE GOODWILL OF ITS ENGINEERS to execute the precarious strategy it's chosen.
