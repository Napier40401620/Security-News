        Ok, I'm going to try to pull a @chriseng today and tweet some talk highlights.pic.twitter.com/GxRIETFtRT
        First up, Henry Bzeih, from @Kia.   Talking about security researchers and how we're probably not bad ;)
        He is talking about cars need more ECUs and more CAN traffic as time passes.
        Now he's talking about Auto ISAC, which is a collaboration group of auto makers, OEMs, and suppliers.  Security researchers not welcome.

        Okay now we have Andrew Hoog talking about mobile app security.pic.twitter.com/O2KifJBdIN
        Mostly talked about generic mobile security and SDLC.  Turns out I know about this stuff already :p

        Oauth: outsourcing your security to a third party provider. Doesn't make sense for all threat models, but better than plaintext passwords
        I see some programmers heralding Oauth as the end-all-be-all of password security and I just shake my head.

        Wow totally unacceptable NTPsec did not use mitigations like stack cookies or ASLR until a week ago https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/Secure_Open_Source/Completed#ntpsec ... 
        ntpsec is not a serious project. It's simply a hostile fork of the NTP Project, with some "security" branding as a funding ploy.https://twitter.com/computerality/status/846775280941326338 ... 
        Amusingly: Cure53 found NTPsec managed to reintroduce a sev:hi vulnerability.
        NTPsec now announces other projects vulns along with their own. Note that only 1 of those is a meaningful bug; the rest are sev:lo.pic.twitter.com/lt4ZkYFFhF
