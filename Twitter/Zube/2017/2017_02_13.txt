        Not sure which is worse: people referring to anti-Trump protestors as "outside agitators" who know the phrase's history, or those who don't.
        TL;DR: anyone calling protestors "outside agitators" is not in the best company, historically speaking.
        ... and "paid protesters" harkens a turn of phrase that would have been right at home in George Wallace's vocabulary.
        Several top scientists have been excluded from the US by the President's travel ban. Not the main purpose, just a side benefit.

        I met up with a friend I haven't seen in years by chance yesterday, and today he was at the top of my LinkedIn recommendations. Coincidence?

        Apotheosis of this phenomenon: PCI testing.
        We called the work we did at Matasano "pentesting" but: little or no truth to the idea it replicates real attackers. And not the real point.
        I see the work as a software engineering practice and am happy with the work we delivered; it needs a better name, though.
        None of us nerds are doing shit to resist compared to the ORD lawyers. All day every day at T5 collecting reports. Till last flight arrives.
        There are probably 5 lawyers waiting outside the door at T5 right now, waiting to see if anyone needs to give a report about CBP abuse.
        Is this happening at ATL and SFO and BOS? Is someone bringing them donuts and helping with IT and safety stuff?
        A "like" on that means "that's nice, Thomas." An RT means it's important.
