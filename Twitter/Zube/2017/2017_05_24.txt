        I don't know whether it's mentioned in this paper, but another noted that they used air-pressure sensors to compute height above sea level.
        They then had an array of height bounds which caused the car to go into the low-emission mode. They matched known testing facilities.
        So even if the test strayed outside the usual speed bounds, the elevation test would identify that they were at a test facility as a backup.
