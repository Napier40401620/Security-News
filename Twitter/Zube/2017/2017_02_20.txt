        Economic modeling isn't a science, it's a bunch of political assumptions plus math. CBO/Fed are very political.https://twitter.com/crampell/status/832693061121560578 ... 
        As a con artist, Trump actually sees the bullshit in our institutions, and uses our own blindness to that bullshit to destroy our democracy.
        CBO's been wrongly estimating a return to 3-5% interest rates for ten years. That kills the ability to engage in good policymaking.
        The Fed and CBO projected the cost of repealing derivatives regulations in 2000. That cost? Zero dollars. That's political manipulation.
        Alice Rivlin at CBO established CBO's credibility by killing Jimmy Carter's energy legislation. It's always been political.
        The Fed and CBO's macro-economic modeling does not include banks or credit. I mean, at some point it's just arguing about aesthetics.
        I have been in rooms where these economists laugh quietly about how their models don't work and they are pretty much making shit up.
